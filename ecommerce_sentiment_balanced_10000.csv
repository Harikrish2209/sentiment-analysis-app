My laptop came with drivers file already placed in D drive. Keypad feels good while typing. This laptop falls on the heavier side.

"So, how do I start. Everything in this mobile is great. What surprised me is that all these features came in an aggressive pricing and made by Samsung. Firstly, the looks. It looks so slim even as it holds a massive 6000 mAh battery. I am a normal user and battery have me nearly two days, which is great. Rating 5/5 Performance wise there are no lags or Grange drop. Rating 5/5 Camera is excellent. I took few shots which came out amazing. A little bit improvement is needed, but even as of now this is cool. I am already using M20, but this is far better, which have some decent shots. Night mode is great and image shows a lots of details. Wide shots are more wider compared to M20 and image quality is also a lot better. I have also recorded a super slow motion video of reason and just looks amazing. We can see every single drop off rain in the video. Night images with flash came out great. I cannot say anything about daylight photos. These images are just out of thought. Images look so sharp and clear. Closeup shots looks great. It would be good if macro feature is also available. Rating 5/5 Coming to display, in one word, Superb. Screen is massive and looks good in hand Touch is buttery smooth. No one would say anything about Samsung's AMOLED display. Its just great. Rating 5/5. Sound is crystal clear and loud enough. Rating 5/5 No heating issues yet as I am not a heavy gamer. Overall, this is beast mobile on an aggressive pricing from Samsung. I am very much happy with the purchase. Overall rating 5/5.",positive

"I bought this mobile for battery life and I'm absolutely happy that this mobile could last more than a day beyond my extensive usage(6-8 hours of calls & multiple business apps). Thanks a lot @Samasung for the battery beast. I had Redmi A2 earlier, which use to last hardly a day with full charge. Comparatively screen quality is quite impressive than A2. Its been a fortnight usage, Over all experience is 4.5/5 considering camera quality, processing speed and fingerprint reader. I haven't tested with fast charging but it takes 2 hrs to charge from 10 - 100% with box charger. I would suggest to go with this if you are looking for battery life budget mobile with all required features like ""fingerprint scanner, good battery life"" etc. Cons: 1.No NFC support so contactless transactions not possible. If you are serious about contactless payment just think. 2.No on screen fingerprint reader and in this budget segment with all features and back side reader, this is ok. 3. With given charger it takes time to charge mobile so we may need to buy a fast charger separately. 4. No ear phones in box, we have option to buy desired headset than getting a basic ear phones.",positive

"Came to this phone after selling my Google Pixel XL, which was a great phone on its own, but wanted to see what the fuss is about iOS and Apple's better app ecosystem and all that. My main comparison of this phone will remain with the Pixel. Positives first: - Top class build quality. The phone looks solid, feels solid. Finishing of the product is top notch. - Taptic Engine. Vibration motor of a phone is a hugely important thing and this phone has the best vibration I have ever experienced. No Android flagship phone I have used has anywhere near the intensity or quality. Reminds me of the olden days of them Nokia phones with huge vibration motor inside them. Great job there hands down. - Camera is good. In low light especially. Noise are kept well in control. Overall the camera can't beat Pixel, can't beat a lot of other phones anyway, but its a good camera, especially for someone who used to use DLSRs for long time to appreciate natural, less saturated output. And video quality is tremendously good. Though the front camera is awful. I almost never use it, but coming from a Pixel it felt like having a VGA front camera. - Fingerprint reader is in the best position in front, and it works every time. - Smoothness. Well smoothness is good. Definitely much less frame drops overall across the UI than Pixel, but not to an extent where it could make significant difference anyway. - RAM Management. Excellent. For a phone having 2 gigs of RAM, well I can only laugh at Android. Where Pixel reloaded apps with double RAM, this thing can apps in memory. - Battery life. Very good. For a tiny sized battery, I am getting 6-7 hours of SoT with 24 hours of standby time. - RAW Speed. Needless to say anything about the A10 chipset. It chews graphically demanding games and apps like nothing. There simply is no Android phone which can come anywhere close. Now the Negatives, which outdo the positives for my usage: - Most impractical and unintuitive OS I have ever experienced. The scrolling mechanism is stupid. You can't scroll fast up or down, it will stuck at a point, so you will get tired. And it misses some touches in the process to. Waste of time. Free flow scrolling for life. Then there is no system wide BACK option. This will drive you bonkers if you are coming from android. Every app is different, where most apps do have the gesture support of left to right to go back to previous screen, its still nowhere near as fast as simply hitting a back button. And on some apps there simply is no gesture support, like Paytm for example. And the back button is located on TOP LEFT corner, which you can't reach with one hand, and I am using the smaller version of the phone. You can touch the home button twice to activate a reduced sized display of current screen, but it goes away as soon as you do something which requires to move to another screen. Ridiculous beyond explanation. Also there is no share option to other apps like Snapseed or Drive or Google Photos directly from the native Photos app! Another time wasting thing! There is no T9 support on the native dialler. ROFL. - Call quality. I don't know but I just don't like the call quality, especially when I am coming from a phone which had brilliant call quality. - SAR value! Don't know how it could be that absurdly high! Check GSMArena specs! Scary really! - No fast charging. This simply should be here. Even this smaller battery takes full two hours to charge fully, LoL. That's it basically. When this phone works for a lot of people, who think that this phone is miles ahead in terms of whatever, probably for the fruit logo at back side, this was simply not for me. Absolutely ridiculous amount of time I wasted trying to do simple things. I never did care about the Apple logo, God knows which type of people care about that, so for me, I need something which is much more practical, much more intuitive, and which won't drive me bonkers for simple stuffs, so yeah that was Apple for me. Best of luck. Regards, Saurav",negative

"Have been using the phone for the past 2 weeks. This is my first Samsung phone. Would not go for Samsung in the past as they were too expensive and laggy in the midrange models. My previous phone was an Asus max pro m1 which was excellent but the battery had puffed up within 13 months and hence I decided to replace it. Would have blindly gone for another Asus but there was no proper successor to the max pro! Anyways, the hiccup I mention happened to be this weird behavior of my idea sim. The idea sim would not allow itself to be registered on the network. I would get the network bars but no calls ,no internet could be made. Tried multiple idea sims but same issue. Vodafone n jio worked fine. Amazon customer support was poor. I explained the problem but they insisted on sending a technician to physically inspect the phone a week later. I had to roam with two phones for over a week as I use dual sims. First time I was disappointed with Amazon return policy. Anyways, the technician dint turn up( great after sales support Amazon!!)and I just reinserted the idea sim into the phone and it worked flawlessly. I have no idea what made it work but there was some writing on the Samsung box mentioning using Indian sim card first and then other foreign sims can buy used. Never heard of this in any other phones I had... guess this was causing the issue . Now the everything works fine! I hope it doesn't return again as the replacement window is over . The positive are its 6k mAh battery though it shows it to be 5800 odd mAh design capacity on AccuBattery and 5364 mAh as estimated capacity. I get 10hrs screen on time which is what I expected. I am a heavy phone user n hence I needed a big battery phone! The camera is good enough and the amoled screen is awesome! The negatives which might put of some people are the lack of ambient light sensor, it automatically adjusts brightness but it's a little slow to react,seems to use the front camera to assist in that. This makes finding the answer menu difficult if u pull ur phone out of ur pocket in bright sunlight. Due to my initial hiccup, feel network range is spotty, making calls require two tries to connect sometimes, happens on n off. No double tap to wake makes u use the physical button wake the phone. The phone doesn't come with Corning glass, so a screen guard is a must. Also the speaker is that loud enough. Overall, a very good device from Samsung, worth it for its battery and screen. Lack of ambient light sensor is the only negative that impacts me a lot.",positive
"It took quarter of a century to accumulate information and write this book, such a persistent and consistent effort. The author had written a great book of life full of lessons. It is written on the back of this book that "" this book is probably the best self help book ever written"" i agree with that line and support it. This book was published in 1940's ,a bit old book but had every bit of relevant and eternal information which we think of now and ever. THINK AND GROW RICH was the title of the book but reading this book twice I came to know that lot more titles suit this book and a few I thought were THINK AND GROW PERSONALITY THINK AND GROW CHARACTER THINK AND GROW WISDOM THINK AND GROW MOTIVATION. Fabulous book and continuing to admire the work.",positive

Have received feedback from friends who were on the other end of call. Audio: Audio is quite good, bass is alright, the level you can expect at this cost. Comfort: Comfortable to wear, the earbuds fit perfectly, just the little rubber thing sometimes doesn’t fit in my ears (guess it is meant for bigger ears) Connectivity: Range is about 5-6ft, not more. Sorry to say this but I have faced this issue with all bluetooth headphones. So I guess either you buy more expensive or stay within this distance of your phone/laptop.

I really dont know abt performance of othe brands at this price.....but honor 8x will not disappoint you....it has a great picture quality....and a good battery life.....i'm satisfied,positive
"Great phone, but disappointing nonetheless. Given the price that we pay, the satisfaction is not fulfilling. Pros: 1. Great display, 90hz display does wonders. (But you'll get bored of the smoothness within a day, wanting for features more useful, more evident, more everyday). 2. Fast charging is fast enough. Thank you for giving it in the box. 3. Plus point for the design. Camera design is great compared to the square fiasco by other phones. Back is awesome, both the Colors. Looks very premium. (But surely you'll keep a case, hiding the greatness of the back). 3. Oxygen OS is great compared to most other customised OS. Fast and smooth. 4. Phone performs without any lag whatsoever with heaviest of usage. (Battery optimisation is not that smart, apps reload quite a bit after minimising and reopening them. Real time messages are sometimes not shown till we open the app say WhatsApp.) 5. Great box (no utility though, only the feeling.) 6. Cover supplied with the phone may not be beautiful, but is strong enough and has proper cuts. 7. Battery is good. (But with 90hz display and possibly heavy usage - obviously, hence bought the phone with 855+ - the battery drains quite quickly. 3800 is less compared to the average in budget phones.) But anyway, it covers the whole day and fast charging in the box is a good move. 8. Love the side slider for sound. Cons: 1. 3.5mm to C converter not provided. (Should've given that instead of the cover, as cover is a personal choice but the converter is useful to all) 2. SIM tray design is very bad. (My SIM tray got stuck on the very first day, will have to go to the service centre, god knows how much they'll charge.) SIM tray should have a lock system which holds the cards intact to avoid such problems. (Network is working fine, just the tray won't come out, so I can't change sim card now. Really disappointed with this issue on the very first day.) 3. Camera performance, battery performance, and sound quality is good, but expected more at this price point. (Though fast charger, number of camera types, and stereo speakers are the plus points.) 4. Heavy and fat phone, if you previously used slim and light phones. 5. Android system utilizes almost 28GB of storage. (64 GB version is not present for a good reason.) 6. Somehow, not that satisfied or happy after getting the new phone. It's a great phone, but still I feel a bit overcharged due to the cons faced. I believe, all utilities should be provided out of the box, for example 3.5 mm converter, or c-type earphones, or wireless earphones, fast charger, lens cleaner and glass cleaner, etc. And all personalization accessories like covers, screen guards, lens guards, stickers, etc can be purchased by users themselves. This increases the overall utility of the box bundle. Here I'm purchasing an already expensive phone and then paying several more for some really necessary accessories.",neutral

"Don't know why this has so fewer 😞 reviews here:- Here's my take on this ⭐️LATEST FIRMWARE UPDATE:- It received SpO2 which measures your Blood oxygen level and heartbeat/minute. I bought it on a deal at 2299/- I gave it 5 stars and that's all for the reasons. I like the blue color over black because it looks different and sort of professional than the black color. This is what I think, your choice might be different. ✔️ So let's talk about the BUILT QUALITY first:- ------------------------------ 1- The screen is AMOLED Touch Display, it's very vibrant and the color looks too good. For such a small screen the text and graphics are very legible. It's very sharp and clean. 2- It has 2.5D Curved Glass, looks neat and bright. 3- Screen size is 0.95"" AMOLED Touch Display with Up to 282 PPI (wow!!!) 👍 5- The strap is rubber or resin sort of material, it's textured with watch kind of design and thus makes the band secure in your hand. ✔️ FIND PHONE:- 📱 I really like the FIND PHONE feature, it rings your phone...very helpful if you forgot 🤔 where have you kept your phone. ✔️ BATTERY LIFE:- ⚡️ As most of the reviews and honor itself claims it has 14 days of battery life, le de ke 8 se 10 din ki to milegi hi bro. And if you worry about portability it's not a big issue. So do not take it as its negative. The charging cradle is so small that it can fit in your pocket. ✔️ COMPARISON:- People comparing two bands these days Mi band 4 and Honor band 5. Now which one to go for? let me tell you both have almost near same specs and feature. But I like the built of Honor. I like its band quality, it feels secure in hand because of the watch kind of strap design. The Honor band also included SpO2 and Music control features now!! 😎 The Mi band 4 has so many watch faces which you won't find on Honor band 5 but trust it's not a big issue for me. If you love faces you may go for Mi but Honor is top on accuracy. ✔️ FACES:- It has a total of 8 watch faces and it's not a big deal to cry. You do not have much time to change watch faces every minute...I feel 8 faces are cool for me. I attached pics of the faces...photos are not sharp because of light reflecting from the watch but it's super sharp in real!! ✔️ SCREEN QUALITY: Excellent 2.5D Curved Glass, 0.95"" AMOLED Touch Display with Up to 282 PPI. The pixel density is amazing for such a small screen. ✔️ TOUCH:- Touch is not buggy and has no lag at all. It's a smooth swipe. ✔️ BRIGHTNESS:- You can change the brightness to low to full. However, under direct sunlight, it feels a little dim but not an issue of tension. ✔️ FEATURES: 1- Latest firmware included SpO2 ❤️ and Music control 🎵 features which were missing earlier in India unit. I'm using the music feature with Apple Music on my Android phone. It can pair with any media player on your android phone 📱 2- Home screen is beautiful and tells you about: a) Time b) Day and date c) Steps d) Calorie burnt e) Distance travelled in KMs 3- Additional screens are:- a) Music b) More c)Messages d) Workout e) Sleep tracker f) SpO2 g) Heart rate h) Steps Under MORE icon you have:- timer, stopwatch, faces, find phone, brightness, screen on, battery, system The steps taken by me is almost identical to the Google fit app on my phone. ✔️ VARIOUS FITNESS MODES:- a) outdoor run b) indoor run c) outdoor walk d) indoor walk e) indoor cycle f) cross trainer g) swimming h) rower i) Free training. ✔️ SPO2:- I've compared its SpO2 with my real Oximeter and both showing the same reading. Now you can conclude how accurate it is on Honor band 5 😲 The 24/7 Heart Rate Monitor is very accurate 👌 too and shows the exact+- reading matching to my real Oximeter. ✔️ HONOR ANDROID APP (Huawei Health):- the Honor app for android has very intuitive UI, lets you customize features on your watch. Firmware updates have been done using the app itself. Connection is very easy using Bluetooth of your mobile.

The most appreciable thing about this device is it's battery it's generally gives you a backup of almost one and half days on a single charge. Display is also awesome as we already know that's its a super amoled display made by Samsung may be better if it comes with Corning gorilla glass protection. Another good thing about this Samsung device is it's processor Exynos 9611 as it is a processor made by Samsung itself so RAM management and hardware and software optimizations were very good. Go for it if you want a trust of brand along with great specifications in a considerable price segment.,positive

"Amazon - Thank you! for selling genuine products. My Review on Xiaomi Mi A2 (Gold, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage) Internal Storage: 48.9 GB for end user, post android pie up-gradation and required apps installation, will have 46 GB of internal storage. Phone display and performance wise its an excellent against the price. Have observed camera quality was superior post android pie up-gradation. Battery is average for moderate usage and can be better if its preferred to kept on saver mode activated. Best part of mobile its built with quality speaker which would be louder & clear on speaker phone. Led indicator is bright and clear in view which would be best added feature where most of other brand smart phones are not provided with this facility. Over all phone is very good in built quality. Xiaomi - Since you are marketing your brand in India and now you have successfully established as an one of the top smartphones manufacturer, hence request you to provide good quality of headphones which can make customer feel happy & healthy to avoid direct interact of mobile to one's head and where radiation intact (SAR) would be in low frequency.",positive
Worst phone. Hangs a lot. Very slow and sluggish compared to realme c1 and redmi 5a or even redmi 2 prime! Photo quality also worst front facing camera. Processor is very far behind in real life usage compared to snapdragon 450 in realme c1. Can't play pubg even in low quality as it hangs. Display is also not so large compared to realme c1. Please by honor or realme c1 or asus zenfone max pro m1 instead of this. They said after I purchased that I cannot return product for phones. So got my money wasted so please don't purchase. Display is also poor when watching video at start then recovers slowly. In general not a worthy phone at all by Xiaomi! It has become money minded.,negative

"I've been using the phone for a few days now, upgraded from One plus 2 due to budget constraints. However, I did not expect much from this phone. But I would honestly like to say that I am very satisfied with the product as it offers features like the other phones in the higher price range. Pros: 1) The battery is a stand out component as it easily helps you with being outdoors without worry. Just one charge can get you through one and a half-day of heavy usage. 2) The features almost look like the same on the higher flagships from Samsung. 3) The storage is great as well 128 GB + 512 extendable is sufficient I guess. 4) The brand value stands a chance to sell the phone within a year with a good return with the Exchange option on Amazon itself which you will not get through direct vendors. 5) The finger print reader works great as well. Con's: 1) The phone does not feature notification lights, so you will have to count on vibration or the notification sound. 2) The screen is not that great with regards to the other phones in this price range, but it is okay to compensate for the other features that the phone has. The darks don't really stand out, Its just like a normal 1080p screen. 3) The camera as well only performs fair enough only in the day time not that great in the dark. 4) Slightly bulky so ya it justifiable for the config provided. Not that big of a con. Overall, great price for a year use and value for the config provided. I am satisfied thank you #Samsung #Amazon. Great work!",positive

"Product has been as per my expectations. Big Battery-It lasts for about 2 days on normal usage and fast charging is marvellous. Latest Software-It received android 9 update last month. Good Performance-Doesn't lag with normal usage i.e. Without having heavy games. Multitasking is possible. Big Display with Bluelight filter protection for eyes. Water drop Notch is trendy. Sound quality is good- Dolby Audio Present but works only in Headphone mode. Camera quality is good than others in this segment. Dual camera is a new feature. The interface is easy to use. The only thing which I disliked is that the Alarm doesn't work in Power off mode unlike my previous phone, which had this feature. Also the DoNotDisturb option is not upto the mark.",positive

"I bought the phone on the 2nd day of the sale (Oct 1st) with an estimated delivery date of Oct 3rd however, to my surprise, Amazon delivered it the very next day. I opened the phone and checked all the features and like almost all except one, the rear camera, which I was expecting to be better than others available in the similar price range. However, it really disappointed me. The pictures taken from my old Lenovo phone was way better than newly purchased Samsung M30s. The worst part with the phones is that you cannot return it once bought. I would expect Samsung to improve the picture clarity in future updates however, if it is not done, then I am sure that I will never buy Samsung phones in future and even would not even recommend it to my known ones.",neutral

I think in the low budget mobiles the Samsung M series is the best series. Samsung galaxy M20 is the best mobile under 12000 range. The v infinity display is given awesome look. The camera is super. Quality of images are too good. The wide angle given you a awesome picture. The battery life is just awesome the 5000mah battery given you 1.5 to 2 day battery life. The Samsung processor is too good . After using of 3 months i would say the mobile is overall awesome in budget .,positive

"Writing this review after almost one month of usage.. Pros.. Great picture quality Keyboard for remote backside is awesome to type anything without any issues One click button to view the files in a pendrive or harddisk..(its supporting 1TB hard disk withou any lag) Eshare app is awesome through which you can view your mobile screen in TV aswell as you can view the TV screen in mobile which is mind blocking. Everything is just awesome and its better than any other bigger popular brands. Playing FLV and avi file formats also.. Cons.. Only one con I observed is that whenever you play 4K video from youtube ,some times youtube app will struck or wont able to play any videos..Reason for this can be only 1GB RAM but 4K videos were of very big size like just one 5 mins song itslf can be of 1GB which needs buffering and storage of that much data before playing... As of now I am very satisfied with this TV...picture quality is also awesome..",positive

The TVs smart features are work very awesome. Though I basically used it for video content...like YouTube and others which works fine...with phone it's also works great.. and even 4k videos are streaming in it is exceptional. Sound is also awesome no need to have separate sound system. The only problem is the remote control. As a great product like this should have a magic remote.. sometime surffing youtube or web by remote control can be a headache...though with smartthings app it can be a little easier,positive

"Brought this mobile for my mom. Manily purchased it keeping budget in mind and my mom's a ability to handle a smart phone. Not regreting too much since the user is amateur. But, if you are an advanced user or a gamer kindly avoid this phone. There are few more options available if you can able to add few more thousands to your budget. Build quality is okay Display is okay, not that great. Keep in mind that you can only watch 720p YouTube videos only. Camera quality is not that great. Remember, it has got only 2GB ram, when running on Oreio and Pie 3GB is mandatory. So, you can notice moderate lag. Battery life is not up to the mark. It's only 3000mah battery. Can stand for one day if used moderately. Takes lot of time to get fully charged. The charger capacity is only 5volt and 1amps. Speaker volume is low and when you are on call it's moderately loud. Signal quality is good. If you are really tight on budget, please accumulate few more bucks and go for other options in the same price range other than this. This is purely ment for amateurs.

Many complain about camera because by default it shoots with 12mp shooter... I m not a good photo graphed.

"After complete one day used result. 1. Battery performance is not as expected. Samsung claim 6000 mah but actual its not, it's look like 4000mah battery. 2. Display is good. 3. Camera is not as expected, front is 16 MP but acutal its look 8MP , same about rear camera, you will see noise in camera, depth camera is good, some camera effects are good. Overall camera is Ok but not upto the mark. 4. Phone body is plastic must handle with care, if you drop you'll lost. Samsung little bit disappointed this time. Result : Good",neutral

"As several people have said, this book is indeed life changing. The major takeaways from this book for me were methods to 1) fill myself with positive thoughts and keeping negative thoughts away 2) not focus obsessively on real or imaginary health issues (I have had health problems for several years now). As we all know ""fill yourself with positive thoughts"" etc. are easy to say but very difficult to do. This book gave me methods and frameworks to actually go ahead and to it ! What you take away from the book will depend on you. As the author says, the goal is not just to help the reader accumulate wealth, but to help him/her towards other life goals as well (relationship, career, etc.). This book is not coffee table reading though. You will need to study it closely, critically and with your eyes and ears open. Contemplate on what you read. Meditate on it. Read it again and again and again. And see your life change. Good luck !",positive

"It is a really nice phone!!! Very nice to hold and looks good!! Missing the 3.5mm jack though!! Came factory sealed and on time One important thing to know if your phone is genuine factory sealed or not is to check whether the box has a small flap below it, The flap is pulled to break the seal and the phone can be unboxed after that. (You can check various unboxing videos on youtube for the same) If the seal does not have the flap do not accept it.it means its tampered",positive

"I purchased this phone during great indian festival sale . I have been using this from last 10 days .

It almost last for 1.5 days with average usage and 2 days with less usage. UI of samsung is very user friendly. Camera is superb. I love the slow motion feature and super slow motion feature. Some feature requires lights such as live focus. some photos I clicked of Ravan and some fireworks camera performed excetionally well. This phone is Awesome in this range price",positive

When you press power button you need to wait 20 sec to see the screen. 4 when your phone call is done, you need to wait till others cut the call as you may not see the screen immediately after phone call. 5 replaced my phone 2 times in Hope of solving 3 and 4. No use. So the product itself is corrupt not just my piece of phone 6 . Even after all kinds of troubleshoots by me and technician. Basic issues not solved. So returned my phone even though I love its features and looks , it has serious ’screen goes blank' issues. We always click power button to unlock our phone.. but when you click power button it takes at least 20 seconds to show you screen.. just try to wait 20 seconds on any phone for unlock and if you are okay, this is the best phone in recent times in this budget. :-) all the best",negative

"I brought this for my father, and I could say its best phone ever in the midrange segment. Based on my personal opinion below are the pros and cons with their ratings Pros: 1. Build quality- 9/10(Camera Bump can be little small) 2. Camera- 10/10 3. Sound- 10/10 4. Cellular call quality: 10/10 5.Android One- 10/10(Regularly security updates) Cons 1. Auto brightness sensor: There is issue with this sensor calibration not done properly can be fix by software update 2. Camera Bump : It can be little smaller due to this we can not use the phone without cover if we use this without cover the camera glass can damage or will get some scratches on the camera glass. Overall the phone is best in midrange segment",positive

"If you're looking into getting a new smartphone you might find all the technical lingo a wee bit confusing.There are so many technological specs associated with buying a phone that knowing what's what can be tough. Not to worry though, I hope my user experience helps in solving your query. TOP SPECS: One of the most important specs on a cell phone is the CPU or processing spec.Basically, the CPU of your phone is sort of like the brain of a human body, and the more powerful the BRAIN is, the faster and more responsive your phone will be.As phones become more powerful, processors are getting into dual core & quad core territory .This MONSTER comes with Android v9.0 Pie operating system with 2.3GHz + 1.7GHz Exynos 9611 octa core processor .So, it makes this a top end phone in this price bracket as top end phone these days are getting over 2GHz of power.I have purchased the 6GB RAM/128 GB storage - opal black colour,For a budget killer smart phone the build quality is superb The back side is a dual colour and has a mixture of turquoise blue. DISPLAY: Screen material makes a big difference too. Phones from a ""Fruit named Company"" still have LCD displays, which in today's time is just not fine. But with the new Samsung M30s we get (6.4-inch) FHD SUPER AMOLED + capacitive touchscreen with 2340 x 1080 pixels resolution 16M color support.With the new SUPER AMOLED technology tend to produce screens that are a tad brighter and have better colour reproduction. CAMERA: Once considered a luxury in smartphones, the camera is now an integral part of smartphones.There is a whole lot more to any camera than megapixels.The quality of the lens,the camera software and the presence of options like autofocus and different scene settings make a world of difference.Samsung M30s comes with 48MP + 8MP + 5MP triple rear camera | 16MP front facing camera.Photos taken from M30s are decent and look good on the phone's SUPER AMOLED display, Daylight shots are average and on zooming the stored image it gets grainy. You will have to be patient with this phone while getting the best from its camera. MONSTROUS BATTERY: The battery determines how long your phone keeps working on a single charge. As phones get bigger, so do their batteries.Battery life is the highlight of the Samsung Galaxy M30s and the 6000mAh battery does help this smartphone going on for a very very long time before it needs to be plugged in. While battery life varies a lot depending on how you use a phone, I tested this phone's battery by running PUBG on it that too on high preset mode, I played for 30 mins and noticed a 6 percent battery drain, The phone did not get warm which was impressive to set a benchmark. VERDICT: Great phone with a 6000mAh monstrous battery. Best display so far for a phone in under 20,000 price bracket. Fantastic performance at multi tasking. Only complain/disappointment :Samsung should've provided earphones and a mobile case.",positive

"When a mobile comes with 3 cameras (one with staggering 48MP in such budget), you would expect it to use all the cameras at all times depending on your choice of shot. But that is not the case with the M30s The Samsung M30s gives you the best of both worlds within its budget. You have the massive battery (Bought this for my mom and she just charges it once every other day for full). Then you also have the good 128 GB storage. I added another 64 GB to it because my mom runs appareals business and needs more storage for her product images. For that part, the device is smooth, very satisfactory and infact more faster in performance compared to her not so old Oppo F7 (6GB+128GB). Given that both these phones have the same memory specs, the galaxy M30s clearly won because of its superior chipset and incredibly low price. While the performance is smooth, the fingerprint is very convinient, I'd like to come back to the camera. As I've mentioned before, all the cameras do not work simultanously for videos. For instance, I pick the long shot and it switches to the bigger camera and the wider lens, for nearby, it goes for the smaller camera and the near lens. But when I tried shooting video, it only picks any one camera. I cannot switch or zoom in using the far camera and only can do so with the smaller cameras. Bottom line, if you are buying this to shoot professional shoes or something, maybe not go for this. But if you are looking for a budget device with faster performance (gaming and what not), neat pictures and occasional videos and massive storage and massive battery, go for this. No doubt in performance or device strength. Hit helpful if you found this helpful",positive

"Pro... 1. Display is very good. Awsome. 2. OS is friendly. 3. Performance is as of now good for average usage. 4.

Plz dont buy this phone. 2. Heating issue during photography and gaming. 3. GPU is not upto the mark as compared to Adreno series. 4. Build quality... Dose not feel like a mid range premium phone. Chinese makers are far ahead in this or below this price range. 5. Hd fon audio o/p and normal speaker o/p has been compromised. 6. Gaming experience is poor as compared to SD processors within this price range. 7. The battery backup has been over hyped. 8. Some one ... In the name of Samsung India, here in Amazon Q&A section, was claiming the front glass was CG 3, but latter found it is dragon tail glass, nowhere in the competition. Amazon, plz take care of this matter. Don't fool the customers. Verdict ... Go for any chinese manufacturers within this price range having SD cheapest... Best regards",neutral

"@Galaxy M30s Design : The design of the Galaxy M30s is not too different from the M30. It gets a similar plastic unibody panel on the back with a triple camera setup on the top left corner and a fingerprint sensor placed above center, making it easy to reach.Again, going with plastic does make the Galaxy M30s feel less premium compared to some of the competition out there, but I really do mind this at all. It keeps the phone feeling lightweight at 188 grams, which is mighty impressive for a phone packing a big 6,000mAh battery. @Galaxy M30s Display : On the front, the Galaxy M30s gets a similar 6.4-inch FHD+ (2340x1080) Super AMOLED Infinity-U display as the M30. The display was a major highlight of the Galaxy M30, so it's nice to see that the company hasn't changed things here on the M30s. It looks as bright and attractive as you would expect from a Samsung display. Bezels around the screen are slim, except for a slightly thick chin. You still get around 90 per cent screen-to-body ratio, which is great.The Super AMOLED display on the M30s offers excellent viewing angles. @Galaxy M30s Performance and Software : Samsung Galaxy M30s is powered by a 2.3GHz Exynos 9611 octa-core chipset based on a 10nm process. This is the same processor that also powers the new Galaxy A50s. The Exynos 9611 SoC is equipped with a Mali G72 MP3 GPU and is paired with up to 6GB of RAM. @Galaxy M30s Camera : The M30s gets an upgrade in the camera department as well. The 48MP triple camera setup is a major buzzword this year and Samsung is catching up to that trend. The M30s offers a 48-megapixel main sensor using its own GM1 sensor.The camera system includes an 8-megapixel wide-angle lens and a 5-megapixel depth sensor. On the front, the M30s offers a 16-megapixel selfie camera. @Galaxy M30s Battery : The biggest feature that separates the Galaxy M30s from every other smartphone right now is the battery. This is the only smartphone in India as of now that offers an insanely large 6,000mAh battery. It even makes the 5,000mAh battery on the M30 look small in comparison. With a huge 6,000mAh battery, Samsung says the M30s will offer a two-day battery life with ease, and I found this to be true and then some. Quick review : 1) Pros.. Stellar battery life AMOLED display Lightweight design Competitive cameras 2) Cons Lacks premium finish 15W fast charging is slow Low light camera performance still feels lacking",positive

"Don't trust the reviews they offer 6 month of extended warrenty for writing good reviews, Customer support is pretty good atleast in Gurgaon but the product quality is extremely poor. I was throwing a very light cushion on chair but it accidently hit the screen just above the chair, you know what!!!! The screen is finished then the very first time I touched it and realised it's just has an thin platic protection. This is the time I realised what is the value of brand. You will be surprised to know that the screen replacement will cost Rs 24K so as the replacement cost of TV. Good to buy a better and reliable brand product than keep on buying this scrap in a chain which eventually will cost you much more. Shame on quality of product.",negative
"YOU MUST READ THE REVIEW AND DECIDE YOURSELF WHETHER TO PURCHASE THIS FRAGILE PHONE OR NOT, BECAUSE THERE NO RETURNS ON THIS PURCHASE! In order to make it available at cheapest possible price Xiomi has cut corners on several fronts. Read on! 1. Sound quality is absolutely not upto the mark! 2. Plastic body is so thin phone has become fragile! 3. Volume Rocker buttons are not going to last for many months, they are thin and weak. 4. No gorilla glass screen, it looks unimpressive. 5. Overall it is totally disappointing to hold the Redmi 6A. 6. Camera megapixles-wise ok, but havent tested the performance. 7. MIUI 10 Great,but with smaller screen not fun to operate it. 8. SURPRISINGLY 2 GB RAM IS INADEQUATE FOR FASTER RESPONSE OF OPENING APPS OR UNLOCKING THE SCREEN. 9. PHONE IS EXTREMELY PRONE TO USUAL USE SCREEN DAMAGE AND WEAR AND TEAR, ALSO NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO WITHSTAND DAILY USE. 10. GOD FORBID, IF YOU DROP THE PHONE ITS 'THE END' FOE THE PHONE!

"A nice phone as per battery and display is. Concerned.Main drawback is that, in this phone we can use only one sim as 4G and another one will be 3G. So if you want to use internet, you cannot use it in the sim inserted in 3G slot. It will enable you to use internet in the 4G slim ONLY. Hence if you have internet in the sim inserted in 3G slot,then you have then you have to opt it as a 4G sim then only you can use the internet. The problem arises when you have one jio sim and another Airtel sim say for example, and if you want to use the internet in Airtel SIM then either you have to switch off the jio Sim and and make the Airtel sim as 4G in the settings provided or else you have to use jio sim only for internet which is the major drawback i feel",positive

"First of all, kudos to Samsung for designing such an amazing phone at a cheap price. This phone is indeed an all rounder in all aspects. Let me sum up my review with the pros and cons... Pros: 1. Super Amoled screen: Amazing Display quality and viewing angles. Just loved the display provided by Samsung. Very immersive experience. If media consumption is your top priority then this phone will not depress you. 2. Monster 6000mah battery: Indeed this phone lasted me for more than 2 days with light usage scenarios. Overall great battery backup. Also there's 15W fast charger in the box so that's an added advantage in charging speed. 3. Performance: With exynos 9611 inside, the performance was pretty solid (like a monster). Multitasking and ram management was also a breeze. Playing high graphic games like pubg would be easily playable under high settings. 4. Camera: It houses a triple camera setup to the back. One 48MP shooter, one 8MP wide angle shooter and one 2MP depth sensor. The front camera is a 16MP shooter. Overall it shoots some great looking photos with good detail and sharpness. Now, however this phone excels in every aspect, there are still some minor cons present with the device which i want to share. 1. Camera: Although the camera quality is pretty great but still the quality of the image is not as expected. Specially the 48MP shooter shoots pictures which are not that detailed as compared with other competition. Also the front camera is little poor in capturing good lighting and detail of the subject under certain scenarios. However there's nothing much complain about the cameras and for this price it is still killer. Hence, my final verdict. If ur budget is strictly under 14k and you want great battery backup and performance then surely go for this phone, you will not be mistaken. However if your budget is little higher and camera is your main priority then I suggest you go for other competition which offer much better value for money. As for me, i am extremely in love with this phone. Thank you Samsung",positive
"Feedback after 4 days of use. Samsung delivered what it had promised. Good camera, battery back up and nice look. Charger cable very short.

In camera location not getting saved. Auto updates not getting installed. Seems some issue with inside GPS chip. After discount and cash back, received it an effective price of 11700.

Display is totally awsum. One bigger advantage is the phone has flat back so you can use without back cover also.",positive

One of the Best Mobile Excellent Camera & Battery backup I gifted 2 handet One for My Abba & one for My Amma They liked it very much:):):),positive
"This is my view about the product. Appearance: good ,compact and lightweight. Camera : quality of the picture is awesome.both rear(triple cam) and front cam pictures are good. Sound: can be better Processing speed and navigation: smooth and fast Memory capacity: I think it will be enough for normal users, I mean people having few necessary applications . Separate slot for memory card needs to be appreciated. Battery : once charged fully it comes for more than a day Fingerprint reader is the another feature available in m30 which still now available only on few phones.",positive

"The iPhone X was a huge gamble from Apple, but one that really paid off. Losing the home button and altering the design was a dangerous move, but one that was sorely needed after years of similarity and the premium design, extra power, all-screen front mix together to create - by far - the best iPhone Apple's ever made. It's impossible to give a perfect score to something that costs this much - but this is the closest to smartphone perfection Apple has ever got. Losing known, reliable elements like the Touch ID fingerprint scanner, the home button; introducing new methods of navigating and unlocking the phone – and charging a lot more for the privilege – seems risky for a company that was already treading new ground by doing away with the traditional headphone jack last year. But the iPhone X is the handset we’ve been demanding from Apple for years – a world away from the increasingly-tired designs that those who just want a new iPhone have had to make do with. So… is the iPhone X worth having? Will it change the direction of an industry where many of the specs Apple has put in – wireless charging, bezel-less displays and face recognition – are already on the market?",positive

"I have been looking for a lot of options to buy a New Tv as my earlier ones was an old Picture tube ones.. My search started with 43 inch TV as a goal... I spent almost a month reading reviews... watching tech videos... Visiting the nearest stores... Initially I thought of budget brands like Mi , Vu, n others with Android n other features... I have observed some defect in each one of these... Some will not have Netflix n Amazon prime like apps even though they say themselves as certificate Android...ofcourse few support Third party apps...but they are not smooth n also won't support 4K n HDR videos... Coming to the panels, I have observed few videos n reviews on net n can find IPS panels are most durable than that of VA panels you see around budget generally... Thanks to Panasonic for providing IPS panels. Finally after all I have gone for this Panasonic 43 inch 4K , the best I can say...it has inbuilt Netflix, Prime N YouTube.. all works perfectly n Even support 4K... Think wisely...these are only major content providers in Indian market today... Ofcourse if you require additional apps...there is a limited option... But Cast option is a good solution for it. overall the best quality picture n sound...no looks back... Panasonic brand service the best I can say... Go for it. Also I got it at almost 18K lower than store outside in Amazon.",positive

"First of all i own a macbook pro 2013 and my expectations from this machine was quite high and it lives up to the mark everything showcased about this laptop is true PROs: Lightweight Privacy mode( i dont think its of use to me but still a good feature) screen is 120 Hz it doesnot get that much heated up boot time ,ssd and processor are awesome. looks are killing CONS: dont expect much from bang and olufsen ,quad speakers are installed still they dont sound loud on full volume they are distorted. screen is good but as said i own a macbook pro so the screen quality is not really good (according to me ) the webcam installed is of 2000s its very stupid , they should have sold it without camera.

"Disappointed. I am currently using Sony LED HD TV which i bought back in 2017 for 70k. I got this LG UHD Tv delivered today and i bought it for my living room. I am shocked with the picture quality. They call it UHD 4K. How can a company use such terms to sell their products. My Sony TV is not even 4k or UHD. Its a regular HD TV and still far better then this so called LG UHD 4K TV. Do not waste your 60k-65k in this piece of crap. Low quality body, Very very low picture quality. How can someone rate this TV a 5 star. I am sure those reviews are from the seller or the company. I could easily get a 50 inch TV for 35k-50k of other brands like TCL, MI, BPL, Sanyo, Onida, VU etc. There are many other brands who provide TV for a cheaper price but i have spent 62k because i was looking for a good quality product. I could easily get a similar or better picture quality on other local brands. I would suggest everyone to avoid this TV. I have raised a return request and the technician will visit me on 3/4/2019 to inspect. This TV also has a scratch. I hope i will be able to return it. I will update the review after the technician visit.",negative

There are so many attractive features in smart motion settings. 5. Speaker is producing low sound. 6. Device is very fast. 7.Battery life is excellent.

The phone is a stunning beauty and gives an amazing first impression, the moment you take it out of the box. I'll have to use it for a few days to comment about it features but meanwhile what I found amazing is the stock Android performance, you get the phone with Android Oreo and within few minutes you get the Pie update and several security updates. Camera of the phone is just brilliant, absolutely stunning. And the speakers are quite loud and clear. If you're getting it at a good deal, then just go for it. It's a classy phone and worth the money spent on it. Exchanging phone was really hassle free, Amazon courier guys did a really fast and great job.

"I have used both Win and mac in my life, and i gonna be honest i prefer wondows. Windows is more user friendly than mac for me . It's price is a bit high for the specs, i mean you can get a qay more powerful laptop in 50k and if you are a gamer don't even think of getting a mac. Ofcourse you get much better battery life than windows , about 12 hrs of battery . So i only suggest you to go for mac if you are a office worker or business man and you work in a place where there is no place to plug in your laptop to charge it. And yeah it is light weight too. And 8 gb ddr3 RAM is slow. You can get 8 gb ddr4 RAM in Windows in that price which will me way more faster than this .",neutral

Back is glossy, It would be too risky to carry the device without cover case though. Fingerprint sensor is excellent.

Dear Viewers I am written this review after usage f 15 days of this phone. Pros: Superb phone with monster battery life. Display is good. Cons: OTG is not supported in this phone. Camera is not like 48 megapixel. Charging cable is very short and back cover is also not provided in box. Back side of phone is simple and plastic not giving rich feel in this price segment. OS is ok Finger print sensor is ok not much faster as redmi. So the conclusion is not looking for battery life. Other things are also important.,positive

"not working in 45 days... I Purchased this cable on July 2019, as the product specifications were very good and it looked very rugged too. The cable was very impressive and it worked fine for about 85 days , but after that I found that the cable end connecting towards the phone end become slightly shaky ( from the molded portion connecting the cable )and this has resulted in charging not happening and every time I had to hold this connecting end in a particular position only then it might charge..the moment you leave it won't work..now I can't use this cable. I am not sure if this happened due to wear n tear or if this is the actual life expectancy of this cable and connector. As this cable has a 6 months warranty, I have contacted the OEM and have raised a complaint and awaiting their input. Hope I can get a replacement.",negative

"I've been an android user all my life until I decided to try iPhone XR for iOS. Loving the camera and battery life is an absolute joy to have. It's been more than a week since I got this phone and I'm loving it. Face ID works flawlessly even in the dark and the dual sim function is working like a charm, I'm using Vodafone as my primary sim and Jio as e-sim and have faced no problem whatsoever. The camera is better compared to my previous android phone. The camera support ""live photo"" which I disabled it because I'm not used to it. It supports video recording at 4K 60 FPS. The camera also supports panorama mode which gives amazing results. Selfie is also good and the screen light up as flashlight when taking a selfie in the dark. I'm not a gamer but I play Ludo King and the game works smoothly. Since the phone has the latest processor I'm sure it won't be a problem even with the latest game. I'm loving iOS so far but I miss the bottom keys found on Android. iOS is fluid and there are no flaws in the OS which I've encountered. I've got iOS 13 update after my purchase and love how updates are distributed globally all at the same time. One minor inconvenience I found on iOS is to download apps more than 150 MB I'm forced to connect to wifi and so far I've not found a work around it. I got adapted to gesture navigation like it was something I've been using for ages. Face ID is an absolute joy to have as I don't have to do anything to unlock my phone, I just hold my phone and the phone is unlocked. And did I mention that Face ID works even in the dark? The lack of notification LED is not a big inconvenience as the screen lights up to show the notification every time I hold up my phone. Regarding the huge criticism it got for the low screen resolution, I don't see any problem as I hardly stream YouTube in 4K. I can view YouTube videos in 1080p without a problem which I feel is good enough as service providers in India never give enough data speed to stream videos in 4K. Regarding the screen in direct sunlight, there's no problem as the screen is clearly visible even under direct sunlight. The speakers on this one are a huge plus point over other devices as the speakers give a 3D surround sound like system. I love the speakers on this phone. Regarding the lack of 3.5 mm headphone jack, I see no problem as the phone is bundled with an earphone which connects to the phone. And yeah If you're wondering how Siri is, let me tell you that google assistant is a much better one. I've installed google assistant and I use google assistant more than Siri as google assistant is more practical. If I were to rate google assistant and Siri on a scale, 10 being the best then I would rate Siri at 5 and google assistant at 9. Overall I'm extremely happy with my purchase as I got it at ₹51,500 (including cashback) for the 128GB version. If anyone wants to give iOS a try then I highly recommend iPhone XR as it is the latest devices from Apple at a reasonable price. The one thing that pushed me into iOS is that Apple gives OS update for 6 years and there is no delay in OS updates. On Android, it is a pain waiting for the manufacturer to release the update after Google outs the update. I hope my simple review of iPhone XR helped you. Thank you for reading. Cheers.",positive

Slightly disappointed with this product in few things. The network reception is poor as it keeps fluctuating between 4g 3g and 2g ( not a network issues as signal strength is very good in other phones).

Battery drains fast if screen refresh rate is set up to 90hrzs. Fast charging can do a full charge within 20 min I guess. The given silicon cover will become red from transparent eventually. No 3.5 mm headfone jack, so bought a Bluetooth one. Amazon exchange policy is bad. Delivery boy came and can not scan the barcode, told that will be back in one hour. After getting out of my house, cancelled the order immediately. Amazon customer care is dumb. Say can not help with that any way. Raised a complaint but never get back to me.

I downloaded backup from cloud store and well only 23 percent was left. Backup included gmail, photos, apps(5 in all) and yes software update also. I just bought it for a change from 4 inches. But if u ask me iphone se is a fine option until you want 6s only. Packaging was good and so was delivery. Got within 3 days considering the originating point and my place are on two extremities.

The camera is Excellent (5 *) Battery backup is good, not great (4*) Range or wifi connectivity is an issue, now its disappointing because before this handset I used to get very good sound quality over Call. But after replacing with this new handset I started getting complaints from another caller regarding voice break. connectivity problem most of the time phone is out of coverage area. Also, this handset takes too much time to connect to WIFI (keeps searching for almost 5 - 6 mins). I think its missing basic phone features.",neutral

"Writing this review after full 1 month usage. Who should buy this fridge ? Why this 3 door if same 330 Liters is available in two doors ? How many in your home ? For starters, we wanted a fridge that could store food for 4 adults and 2 children. I would recommend this fridge (or any fridge of this 330 L size) if 2 adults + is your home composition. There's a lot of space for everyone's food to be stored. What is your vegetable consumption ? Do you buy for the week vs. buying fresh every other day vs. buying lot of veggies and fruits...big fruits, small fruits ? Are you foodie ? Given our family size, we buy vegetables and fruits every second or third day. Cauliflowers need not be broken to be stored, other vegetables needn't be clustered or pushed over other. There's plenty of space for a week's worth of vegetables. 3 door vs 2 door ? The third door literally has given more space since its not sharing the space with main area. There's room that we saw in the showroom's that wasn't same as others. All other fridges of similar size had the veggie area appear big, once we took out the containers we saw that the containers were not upright, they were slanting in, so the space was lesser. I measured the insides with tape on this and other fridges in showroom and then decided to buy this. If you need more space for vegetables and fruits, go for it. If you donot need so much space but what is usually provided in 300+ L capacity fridges, then go for two door. Do keep in mind, the exchange rate of two door fridges (no matter which brand) comes down quiet heavily if you are one of those who would go for exchange in 3-4 years. Our overall experience - My first big budget ( Above Rs. 25,000) online. I was skeptical but the exchange rate offered on my nothing wrong LG two door fridge (around 6,000) without any questions asked was much better offer than some of the retailers in Bangalore who were only willing to pay maximum of Rs. 1000). I bought it for that reason, old fridge had to go out, it was beautiful but space was becoming constraint. Whirlpool have a masterpiece in this fridge. no stabilizer is required, it is very quiet, sometimes I touch to see if its running, the consumption is supposed to be less than that of a CFL in a year, I wouldn't be surely measuring it but its good to know its consuming less power. Vegetables are fresh, cooling isn't a concern. Some found that the light is not LED and that was a problem for them, not for me, its not like you are in darkness when opening the fridge and LED alone would help you find what you are looking for. The light is quiet good, freezer is good too. Whirlpool packing was amazing. I took a video of the unpacking (had to do it myself since the technician was on leave due to festivities, the manager promised to send him after he returns but no one so far). Upon his instruction, I opened the carton and the fridge was surprisingly lighter for its capacity. I and my wife moved it out of the bottom packing, have to do some carrying each side to get it out of the bottom packing). We are very happy with the fridge, the space especially. Mind you its slender and tall and not tall and wide like some of the other fridges. I had expected it to be wider but this was awesome size. We couldn't get the white (white wasn't on exchange), that would be our recommendation, not that this color is dull. This will make you stop and look at the tall steel persona in the room :) Amazing deal from Amazon, prompt shipping, excellent delivery, thank you !",positive
Excellent phone. Light weight and classy. I was only worried about a refurbished iphone being sold as new. But the phone was new and am very happy about it. It arrived early too.

"Let me start off by telling y’all that the battery on the iphone xr is really good it will last you and entire day no matter what you do on your phone. Secondly, i personally feel that any people wanting to upgrade from their iphone 6,6s,7 should upgrade to the iphone xr or the iphone 11. Also about the processor, which is the A12 bionic chip is pretty damn fast and i havent felt a slow down in the phone since i bought it nearly 3 months ago. The face id on the xr is fast and does recognise your face in dark as well as after any facial changes. Also i would like to mention that the face id is now even faster after updating to ios 13. The display is good enough and not as bad as some people mention it to be, although it is lcd. The bezels on the xr are a bit thicker than the xs and the 11 pro but it is still manageable and personally i do not feel that it is a really big issue. Finally i would like summarise and would recommend the xr to all people upgrading from iphone 7 or below. It has all the characteristics you would want in your type of smartphone and would definitely be a great choice for anyone looking to buy a smartphone in the mid-premium range.",positive

"If you are looking for your first DSLR, look no more beyond. Its a little beast that packs everything. Also if u are looking to upgrade with a tight budget this is for u. I was confused between 200d and 800d. 800d has 45 all cross type autofocus points as compared to 9 (with single cross type). Well that looks like a big difference and is a big difference if you are going for high speed action like sports or vigorously moving wild life photos. And thats it, no other significant difference. If u are a family, landscape, macro, type of photographer, 9 points is more than enough as this camera is superfast and efficient in focussing with those 9 points. Now if u want wild life also (like me), this camera can do well with its 9 point. But if you require tracking the fast moving subject, switch to live view and see the magic. This camera has dual pixel cmos autofocus which is lightning fast and smooth in focussing and tracking in live view. As of now 800d with single kit lens and 200d with 2 kit lens are priced almost same. But the big difference for me was the 55-250mm is stm kit lens that comes with 200d. Its the newer version stm lens (not the older is ii) that will cost approx 20000 rs to buy it seperately. Hands on impressions: CONS 1. 9 point autofocus 2. Mini usb port not micro 3. No USB charging (cant use powerbank). You have to take out battery and charge with charger provided. PROS 1. Light weight and compact 2. Crisp images with 24mega pixels 3. Guided menu 4. Good battery life 5. Fast and smooth focussing 6. Variangle lcd with touch to focus (works awesome) 7.wifi image transfer and remote live view shooting with smartphone (you can use touch to focus and change camera settings with smatphone) 8. Many shooting modes including creative modes 9. Full hd 60fps video 10. Timelapse mode",positive

"Unboxing experience is not good because of in-the-box accessories (there are none). Not asking for an earphone but at least a Type C to 3.5mm Jack was expected. Coming to phone. It is fabulous. Screen - Personally coming from QHD display to FHD Amoled display, I can't see the difference. 90Hz refresh rate will make you feel other phones lagging. Build - Build quality is good. Gorilla Glass at screen is good enough to handle little drops. Back glass can be fragile. Use this phone with a case and take it out of it sometime to praise it's look. Performance - No words. Camera - A lot of playful modes that you can try, shooting macro shots is great, video stabilization is good, 960 fps slow motion is also coming to this phone. Photos turns out great, but Colors are not natural. Hope they can fix it with updates. Speakers - Loud and clear. Network Connectivity - Cellular reception is very good, WiFi strength is also good. I am able to use WiFi where my previous phone struggled. Haptic feedback - OnePlus claims they have improved haptic feedback on this phone. They might have done it, but there are better phones out there with better vibration. From my experience, vibrations on this phone is thin but instant. Charging - Warp 30T is very fast. Charges to 100% in about an hour. Some people here are confused regarding the charging brick because they were expecting WARP 30T branding on the included charger. The internal circuitry inside this phone makes charging even faster, the ""T"" is inside your phone not on the brick, that's why included charger is WARP 30 and not WARP 30T. Oxygen OS - Smooth. No lag, no heating, quick updates, inbuilt app lock and call recorder. The best android fork which is close to stock and have necessary functionalities built in. Verdict : If you are planning to buy a practical phone within 40k budget, get this one, you won't regret.",positive

Phone looks Cool and Excellent at it's 1st impression.i got 4+64 @ price of 12600 RS .so it's a good deal at that cost.camers quality is excellent from both worlds.display is crisp and vibrant thanks to it's 6.4 inch SAmoled display.Sound quality is Good.Had a Type C port with 15watt fast charger in the box.bt remember there is no Back case and screen guard in the box.Back side looks like cheap quality material i.e plastic feeling.yet it has dual color gradient design... Performance is good and you can play high end games seamlessly. Though it can't beat Redmi Note 7 pro and Realme 5 pro in performance ratio. Pros- 1. Excellent Display 2. Best battery 3. Best Cameras Cons- 1. No back cover and screen guard in box 2. Back side feels cheap in hand,positive

"I don't like product, I was thinking Samsung will going to be introducing new experiences for customers. Network issue with the mobile many times I have found mobile not able to receive network. Before it I have used vivo in basement I have full network with voda but with this mobile same sim but network lost many time in a day needs to restart.. lost my money. Samsung said 6000 Mah batteries, must work two days but works only 24 hours. And charger is not fast enough...",neutral
Please don get cheated by this corporate heartless giant. Go for vivo z1 pro or realme xt or 5 pro. 4 times better than this phone. 6000 Mah battery is the greatest eyewash of 2019! Even samsung M30 performs much well! The company is so arrogant that didn't bother to provide a back cover even worth 50 bucks or a thin screen film even. Didn't have any minimum in built protection even like gorila glass etc. You will get much great phones in much lesser price. Please abandon this brand. Cheating us for eras.,negative

Worst when it comes to image stabilisation. Indoor and low light photos are useless. Outdoor and brightly light room pics are decent. Battery is average. Camera app needs a lot of improvement - not sure how dual or triple camera works as you cannot adjust background after clicking photos whereas Nokia has that feature inbuilt as it snaps the reference of dual camera which holds the feature of adjusting background even after the photo is clicked. Made a wrong choice considering 15k price was expecting better camera performance. Other features are ok.,negative

I purchased my firestick on 15th Jan 2019 just before the launch of firestick with Alexa new voice remote. It was not bad luck but I feel ditched about Amazon's crude strategy that they gave me 500 discount on the old version remote enabled firestick. Had I known I would have definitely gone for new version. I totally agree with other reviewers who feels that Amazon should buy back/replace old remote at least for those who are still in warranty.

"I got the mi a2 about week back. initially the mobile was working fine and the camera quality was really impressive, however I thought of updating the software as it was showing Android pie update available. I updated the mobile to Android pie. thereafter it showed April security patch available for update so I updated for that. but after updating to April April security patch when I restarted the mobile it got stuck at Android one screen and never moved ahead. I tried all kind of tricks and tips but it didn't work. I had to approach Amazon for the replacement. it's really disappointing if a phone get softbricked because all your data that is there in the phone will get destroyed and you lose your important photos videos notes so many other things. so I am really surprised how MI has released the apr security patch without a verifying. there would be two reasons that either the product that is being shipped by Amazon is duplicate or inferior product or me has lost interest in its A2 model and they are just doing the formality of releasing updates without verifying them and in both the cases it will be a disaster to purchase this phone so my advices stay away from this device",negative

"iPhone X has been great to use. The first thing that comes to my mind is a good speed and long battery life that it has. What not good about it is the cost to maintain the phone. So I did not buy the insurance thinking that I will manage the repairs without getting an insurance. But one fine day I dropped the iPhone X and the back glass of the phone was damaged. So I went to Apple Care to replace it since its looking shabby. To my surprise, I got to know that the BACK GLASS is not replaceable and that to solve this issue you will have to replace the whole phone which will cost Rs.54000 which does not make sense. So one thing is clear that replacing parts are damn expensive and you should buy an Apple protection plan which will cover your phone from liquid and phone damage which you can buy for merely Rs. 8000.

"I purchased the mobile on 28th September. I think Samsung finally listen to their customers and brought very competetive mobile in its class. I have been using the mobile (4GB 64GB) for almost 10 days now. Here are the things i observed One UI seems lighter and simpler than other UIs like Mi UI, colorOS , I observed no lags so far, i really like one UI. Good things: .Super Amoled screen, colors are punchy, viewing angles are great 5/5. .Back camera 48MP, takes really good pictures, turn on scene optimizer for even better pictures 4.5/5. .One UI, simple, light and fast 5/5. .Battery, it is huge and Samsung sw optimization make it even better, i am getting SOT of 9hrs to 10hrs 5/5. .Form factor, it is great in hand and didn't feel heavy 5/5. .Sound quality(Dolby atmos) via headphones 5/5. Not so good things: .Build quality, it is average, i can hear tiny sound when i touch side of the phone 3/5. .Front 16Mp camera is very average and takes soft pics like 8mp 3/5. .Signal reception is also average, you will get 1 bar less signal compared to other phones in competition 3/5. .Back wide angle camera 8MP, taking images when fish eye effect, hope it can be fixed, 3.5/5. Techy and gaming things: .Gaming: i m not a hard core gamer, pubg and wwc2 ran fine better than redmi note 7 pro 4.5/5 .GCAM: camera2api support is limited only, the current gcam ports are not fully working, hope Samsung enables it, to make us tinker around with gcam ports in future 4/5 My opinion: If you watch lot of online content like YouTube, Amazon prime etc., and doesn't bother about issues i mentioned above, go for it.",positive

"I have been using this camera for the past one year and I have always fell in love with the images in produces. This camera has taught me a lot in photography and you have almost all the required options to explore to become a pro photographer oneday. So if you are new to photography then this is the best camera around. Though it is an APS-C camera, the images taken with it, after some post processing, could very well compete with those images taken with best full frame dslrs out there in the market. Take a look at some of my images taken with this camera after some post processing. With my experience with the camera for one year here i have given the pros and cons of it: Pros: >lightweight: easy to carry around. >reasonably wide iso range. >crisp images since anti-aliasing filter is not present. Cons: >sometimes snapbridge is not working but that's t not an annoying issue because u won't use that often. >high-speed sync flash capability is not present.

Camera is average but it can be improved by installing Google camera. Battery life is very good for this price and it is one step ahead with 18w fast charger included in the box. Fingerprint scanner and the face unlock worked fine. No lag is seen. The UI is feature full and the ram management is very good. I never felt that I needed more ram. But I don't about Android update. I think with future optimization the processor will be more powerful. Overall a very good phone for it's segment.,positive

His explanations are done in such a simple manner that anyone can understand and apply it in their lives. Even the anecdotes shared are extremely helpful. As he mentions, knowledge isn't power until it is applied. The purpose of this book is not to tell you something new but to remind you of what you already know and to kick you in the shins and inspire you to do something about applying it. This book in my opinion is a must read for everyone and I've already purchased a few more copies to gift it to my friends and family.",positive

"Like the name suggest the phone packs with a monster battery which can be easly get u through 1 day for a heavy user. The camera quality and performance is much better than its predecessor m30. Fingerprint reader and face id is comparatively fast. PUBG @ high, COD @ mid graphics settings are by default. No problem with smooth gameplay. As always samsung maintain a Full HD + amoled display to its high quality. Crisp and vivd screen. 15w Fast charger included with box. Pros: Battery Display Comparatively light it doesn't feel like 6000Mah battery inside. Cons: Small heating problem. Verdict: If you are looking for a phone between 13k to 18k your option are going to be Vivo Z1x, Realme X2, Redmi Note 8 pro and Samsung M30s. Benchmarks may vary but you dont see much of a pratical difference in daily usage in terms of performence. But the actual difference u are going to notice is in battery life. If you are a heavy user like me go with big battery all others are not much of a big game chainger.",positive

"Review for Kevin 55"" TV Pros: - great picture quality. 4K is real. - costs half of what popular brands charge for this screen size. Cons: - Audio quality is poor. I advise using the headphone jack to get audio out from TV and connect it to a proper speaker system. - no voice recognition feature in remote. - OS is complicated. 3 different app stores. It's confusing to know which one to use to download / update the apps. - NO OPTIONS TO CAST from your cell's YouTube, Netflix, Prime, Hotstar apps. You can mirror your cell's screen though, but that is also limited to few cell phone models. The only way to use these apps is via TV remote, which is a BIG PAIN. (I finally found a hack for YouTube. There's an option in YouTube settings to link it with yours cell. But that's only for YouTube. Netflix navigation is still a massive pain via the remote) Tip: you could consider using it with Chromecast device could solve this issue. It costs about 3k only (vs buying a popular brand TV costing 30k more)",neutral

"This is a great tablet with some brilliant features and a few flaws. The good things about this tablet include the screen, which is full HD and looks absolutely gorgeous when used to watch videos and playing games. The 16:10 aspect ratio also means it is great for productivity and dual screen apps. The SoC is Snapdragon 625, which is the best for moderate performance and good battery life. The battery is however small and battery life is decent at best. The worst part about the tablet for me is the fingerprint sensor. It is integrated into the power button, which makes accessing the power button a bit hard as it is recessed. And the finger print sensor doesn't work all the time. It gave me about 60% success rate, which is very bad as the side position means it constantly gets in the way when I am holding the tablet. Overall this is a great tablet, but if you don't have much use for that SD 625 or the screen, just buy the regular Lenovo Tab4 8, which will also save you a bit of money.",positive
What a wonderful phone it is... currently I am using it almost 3 months... No problem. Highly recommend!!!,positive
"To be brief, I find it useless. But read on to find out why. I bought it because it looks incredible, physically. However: - When in standby mode, the screen degrades the quality and the faces look low res. - When used with iPhone, there are no good watch faces at all. Seriously. The only good watch face is one that comes stock that has 2 circles on the sides, one with the weather and one with sunrise/sunset time. I want a watch that does the following: Looks amazing and manly, shows the time at all times, shows the weather, shows steps, shows calories burned, displays notifications and the rest is optional. - It has an always on display but it only lasts 1 day with it on. - It now has a continuous heart rate, but if you have this feature on, it will die before you go to bed. - It has GPS tracking but it will die in less than a day with it on - It has sleep tracking but there will be no battery left to track your sleep, so you'll likely charge it at night. - It has no map app, no GPS directions, you can't use it to guide you around. - The cool spinning gear, gets rotated due to rubbing on clothes and that triggers the watch to wake up, distracting you and other people, wasting extra battery, etc. I emailed Samsung about it and they included an option to disable the gear from waking up the watch in the latest software. One feature that it does great is take phone calls from your wrist. The speaker is loud and clear, but who makes phone calls anymore? So I have used this feature less than 5 times in 1 year. Another feature that's great is being able to play music right off the watch on it's built in speaker. I love this ability but there don't seem many opportunities to use it as I'd rather use headphones on the go and a bluetooth speaker at home. And finally, it's just too big! A standard men watch is 42mm, this is 46mm and it's quite high too due to it's rotating bezel. While I've gotten used to it's size, my clothes haven't. Dress shirts will feel tight around your wrist with the watch on and your wrist will hurt when you wear a winter jacket that's tight around the wrists to keep you warm. Nowadays, it just sits in it's charger and I don't have much opportunity to use it.",neutral

"I bought 6GB variant. It is a well-finished mobile with a high-level processor. But after a few days, I started facing issues with Network and Wifi. Connections keep dropping even if I am near to the wifi, no matter on which network I am, ping rate is too high. I think this was a hardware issue and get it checked with MI service center. They flashed the software. The issue was not fixed. Sevice Center guy is not ready to understand the issue and asked me to keep the phone. I had to sell it soon on Cashify. The hardware is not compatible with each other which causing the issues. Maybe the whole A2 series has this issue. The phone was really good but with this connectivity issue, it became useless.",neutral

"Researched a lot to get a laptop for almost 15 days and didn't want to buy those gigantic gaming lappys but still wanna game some. Came across this beauty as it was a notebook with great and power-packed specs. HP at it's back, it got a thumbs up from me. So using it for three days I have my impressions as below. Build Quality :- Absolutely excellent. Though it is made up of plastic, great finish and not prone to fingerprints. Display :- A FULL HD 1920×1080 panel makes it worth to consume media and other stuff. I loved the display but viewing angle are okaish. Battery :- This is where the device shines. With normal usage it is giving a usage time of 6-7 hrs or more but while gaming it's reduced to half due to the heavy NVIDIA GTX 1050 operations. Keyboard :- Much tactile and solid buttons with brilliant backlit coloured in green. Mouse Pad is average due to non-seperated buttons. Finally, it's a great and ideal deal for a student or other works. Recommended to buy.",positive

"This being my second Apple device. No, I haven't sold my kidney as I got this for about 58K. I have been an avid Android Fanboy using 1+ as my daily driver for the past 5 years. The switch using move to iOS and the entire transition using Drive, Photos etc.. It has been seamless. I may miss a thing or two about 1+ with what a stock Android would offer. Couple of my colleagues argued how good the latest 1+ phones are. Two things that 1+ will never be good at. Photography and Intermittent lag. Yes, a phone with 12 Gigs of ram lags! Now, off to the device. Pros The device's build quality is amazing. The detail given in to every tiny little thing should be noted. Even the Sim tray is made out of metal. Speakers sound better than my previous phone. A couple of you might argue about LCD with lower resolution on the device. I certainly cannot differentiate that though. Color blind maybe! OS - There's no other mobile OS that is this speedy, updated on time basis and supports device for 5 long years. Yeah, you can root your phone and rock new Lineage OS on your Droid but the circumstances of rooting, Magisk cannot help Banking apps work. Camera - There are no other camera phones that are this good. Night mode is amazing. Such low light pictures turn out be so good. Note Huawei phones no longer have Google services yes you can sideload Play Store but that's still pain the arse. Next Pixel isn't going to be cheap either. Cons Remember an iPhone is always treated as an asset than a phone. Ask someone who has dropped his or her phone on a hard surface and the pain that it takes to have it repaired or replaced. Couple of them have pointed out that the device is a bit thick. Yes it is. Honestly slim phones cannot have more juice within. You have to sacrifice either of them. No 3.5MM means you can't charge and listen to music i.e. move on to wireless headphones. Overall an amazing phone that's worth every penny. And a phone that I'd be using for the next 5 years for sure just like my 1+ One The Legend. Electronic goods are always depreciating unlike Gold or Land and fits the needs of checking messages and making calls is all you need.",positive

"I'm not extending the words, its my impressions... We can call it as a ""middle class premium phone."" It gives us the best in a premium feel designz with a 5.99"" lcd display, an average front camera with 16Million Pixels, dual camera with 12mp primary and 5mp depth sensor, and the finger print. I bought it just for ₹8499, and I'm satisfied with it, because, my need was a phone with a minimum requirements that is available at this price segment, and it succeed in it. The face lock feature is quite fast, I like it, the finger print sensor is also quite speedy. But my phone unlocks at the moment when I tap the power button, and it doesn't allow me that little moment to touch on the finger print sensor. The dual back camera is also good, but portrait mode gives some greedy bokeh on the BG, Manual mode is the best in which yiu can control all over your camera. And the main component, the Battery... Mi didn't made so much on the battery in this model, they provided an 3080MAh lithium polymer battery, as i used it for 2 days, and don't feel any problems wih the charge, I don't charge my phone till it gets to 100%, I used to unplug at 90-95%, because charging for long time as well as charging for less time is also quite bad for the battery, so when I charge till 95% it drains faster to a 89% and it stops draining fastly, and provides a quite good battery backup. And the charging also has its own speed, it charges from 57-90% in 25mins, and thats a good part I've seen int his budget phone. I think my review would have helped you. Thanks for reading😘",positive

"First of all about the hardware of the TV: 1. Amazing picture quality 2. Great Sound 3. Easy accessibility of 3 HDMI and 1 USB ports even if it is wall mounted. Another USB port might be difficult to access in case the TV is wall mounted 4. Price is quite reasonable considering the 4k picture quality support. 5. Trusted Panasonic brand gives peace of mind 6. Using it for viewing from 16 ft also without any problem with size About the smart features: 1. Comes with Panasonic's own smart operating system which has its own library of apps 2. As of now, only Netflix, Amazon Prime and YouTube are available in the library along with other apps which are not frequently used in India 3. Hotstar, Sonly Liv and Zee5 are not available in the library. They would be available iff the Panasonic guys incorporate them into the library which is updated from time to time. So you may need Fire TV stick to access these apps on the TV till then. 4. Connectivity to WiFi router is good.",positive

When I tried updating (15-20) times, every time after download of 400MB, installation fails, Shows some error, contacted MI customer care and visited their stores too, they asked me to get the phone replaced, talked with amazon customer care, they are sending technician to check if the product is faulty (5 days later), and only after the technician's check, I will be able to call them and ask for replacement , before that they are asking me visit again MI stores or wait for technician. Too much hassle for this update. Wether the item has faulty software or the MI has software bugs, what I as a consumer suffer? They should have sent me the updated version. Or should send some technician on delivery date to help to update to latest verion of android.

I'm quite satisfied with battery life. Even the performance is also nice but the worst feature of this phone is CAMERA. Despite of having 48MP triple camera the image quality is not up the mark and on zooming the deatils are also missing. 48MP samsung senor can't compete with sony impx363 sensor (used in iPhone 5) & I can't say anything about selfie camera because 'Worst worst worst' as the photos are really really soft. It could be better if there were no selfie camera. At last 48MP camera is a biggest MYTH about this phone.,neutral

"Here is an easy summary for Samsung M30 to help with your buying decision 1. Great Screen : Samsung makes phenomenal amoled screens and compared to other high specs phone in this range from Xiaomi, the Screen is definitely a win on the Samsung 2. Battery Life : the battery would easily last a day with moderate usage. 3. Camera : the camera on Samsung M30 is surely not for shutter bugs, but if you're looking for a budget phone with a decent camera than M30 can fit into your consideration. The camera can perform well under the daylight but at night it struggles hard. The front facing camera does a decent job during video calls and the wide angle lens is a welcome add on. 4. Performance: if youre reading this review you are definitely not trying to play core heavy games on this phone. Samsung M30 is not for Gaming. If youre considering this phone to play PUBG or Asphalt then dont..go buy Xiaomi. Who should buy M30? The Common Mass, yes as many of us fall under that category, Samsung M30 is your perfect companion.Buy it for the Screen , buy it for the battery and buy it to get day to day things done. PS: I bought this for my Dad and he loves it.",positive

I don't know if xiaomi will deliver regular security updates Verdict It's definitely a good phone for it's price also i just saw it's price increased 600 rupees so i would say if battery life is your highest priority and you can spend extra 1400 go for the realme c1.

"My purchase of Samsung M10s mobile phone has been excellent. The performance is awesome and for the price I paid the mobile phone has met more than my expectations. The fingerprint reading is perfect and the camera quality is extremely good. Compared to my previous phone Samsung On7 this M10s phone has a larger screen 6.4"" infinity v display and a near bezel-less edge to edge HD+screen. Also it has a 3GB Ram compared to 1.5GB Ram on my previous phone which allows me to download many more apps. on my mobile phone. The battery too is 4000mAH lithium-ion battery with fast charging. The display is awesome. My feelings for my new Samsung M10s is beyond expressing myself as the product is very nice performance wise, design wise and price wise. I could happily conclude by saying that I relied on my intuition and made a correct purchase which is paying dividends by way of its features and performance. I would confidently say purchasing Samsung M10s would be the perfect buy.",positive

"Worst customer support...very bad user interface.....worst smart TV. I wanted to give 2 star rating but am giving 1 star just to make sure people can see my review and make a better choice as most people look at 1 star rating only to know how worst the product is. I regret buying this by getting tempted for cheaper price. I learnt the hardway that I made a big mistake. Another mistake that I did was I trusted the reviews (both textual and videos) available over the internet and youtube. Now I realize that the material was uploaded by the manufacturer and their associates with the intention of coercing us into believing that it's a great TV. Better consider other brands even if the price is slightly higher. Read the following and decide yourself whether you should go for this TV or not. Picture quality is good(4/5)....Sound is average(3/5)....User Interface(1/5) Smart TV features... 1) Processor is very slow (takes ages to install apps) 2) Wi-Fi is very week.....compare with amazon firestik and you will understand....videos get stuck in midway and sometimes operating system crashes and the only way to make it respond is to pull the plug out and put it back in..(May be the main processor, Graphics processor and the quality of the motherboard to blame).....In short, you can just forget that it is a smart TV and use it as a normal TV to avoid frustration. Dont buy this if you want a smart TV. But for a non-smart TV the price is a bit high. 3) App compatibility is below average. Better go for Amazon Firestick for the apps that it supports and go for an android box that supports Jio TV and other apps not supported by Firestick. (Plz dont go for china android boxes as they put spyware which you cant uninstall even after rooting the device. If you do, your credentials, activities and critical info will be available to fraudsters all over the world. When I used a chinese android box with netflix on it, my account was stolen, all credentials changed.....which means that I will be paying the monthly fee and someone else will be enjoying my account) Customer care is worst. I had a small issue with the remote and I raised it. The exec came took pictures of invoice and remote and told me that a replacement will be made soon. Nothing happened after that. After few weeks I got a call from the customer care asking me about my experience with the product but when i told the lady about the story about the remote, I was told that warranty was not applicable for the remote. Just imagine guys...what would you do if you receive a faulty remote? And if the remote is faulty do they expect us to walk upto the TV everytime we want to change something (even volume)??? Just think and think wise. BTW I am still using the faulty remote. Finally...If you want to know what's good about this TV....Here they are.... It's a good TV minus smart TV features. Good picture quality....HDR conversion is decent and 4K upscaling is average. Sound is decent. I didnt see local dimming. Blacks are decent not gr8. Not much white color bleeding(many TVs have this problem). HDMI 2.0 with HDCP 2.2 is future proof. (But since I didnt like the smart TV feature, I will change it after one year or so) But believe me guys...response of the TV is very slow and very annoying....if you really want to use it, use another streaming device/box and avoid even changing the input of the TV",negative

The camera is good that makes you beautiful . The back camera is a little disappointing. If you zoom the picture is not clear. But overall this phone is very good . Specifications-slow motion video recording. IR blaster that works like a remote. Flash on both sides -front and back. And many more ...

As par as quality of the camera is concerned initially I was very upset as the camera doesn't give you 48 MP quality but afterwards I realised that it can give 48 MP with certain T&C. But the different modes in the camera is good if u can learn them faster it is better. Video quality ok. So maybe I would give 3.5 to the entire camera. But real plus for this phone is the battery backup which is awesome and after an entire days of work with this phone which includes extensive internet browsing, calling, camera everything the battery still remains at around 40%. Though I have not used in gaming so cannot say how that feedback will be. Fingerprint sensor is decently good but may not be the best. Face id is good so far.",positive

"I bought this for my child who later complained that the phone lags and the battery consumption is high. I called the customer care and they refused to refund or even upgrade to a higher/costlier version of MI Redmi mobile. I researched online and found that Android ver. 8 requires at least 3GB RAM for a seamless experience. The technical support executive agreed to this but said that the mobile can only be replaced with the same model only if the piece were defective. So, the lessons learned are - 1) Research about the hardware requirements of the Android version before you buy, 2) If possible, try out the same model at some offline store or elsewhere before you buy, 3) Note that there are no refunds or upgrades possible after you purchase from Amazon - You'll be stuck with what you buy. As for this mobile, after using it for sometime, I find the performance as ordinary. If your use is high, then go for better versions or mobiles.",neutral

I got a defective iPhone XR. The screen is defective. There’s a blue shade on all the four sides of the screen. The phone’s working completely fine though. So whoever purchased the phone while unboxing please check your device thoroughly. It was my mistake that i thought that maybe it’s something related to software which will be fixed after software update but it didn’t. And in that belief i skipped my 10 days return policy as well. I still don’t blaim amazon because i have purchased my Airpods from them as well. But still appario should not sell defective products to customers. Now i have to go through a hassle of getting the screen replaced from service centre and for that service centre will keep my phone for at least 7-10 days. It’s disappointing that i have to go through all this for a brand new phone. The reason why i didn’t upload a pic is bcuz it will not be visible in a pic taken from another phone.,negative

"The reason I am giving this 3 stars is because of its screen glass quality. You will see that even if you by mistake drop it because of its slippery back you get few cracks on the screen.

I decided to go with this phone mainly because I read about the low SAR value of it. Other than that I think this is not worth the price. Some issues I noticed after consistent use over last more than a week; 1. Absolutely poor response to touch. Precise also seems to be poor. 2. Battery life is also not as expected from this 4000mAh piece. 3. Apps are sluggish on this phone in comparison to even a 1.5GB ram phone. Overall I think it is not worth it.,negative

I am writing my genuine review after using a week.. Battery: the valid thing in the phone is 6000mah battery .. its last more that 48hrs of moderate usage and 3days for minimal usage .. I request samsung have to optimize few steps to improve and charging speed of the battery.. it take 2.30 min to full.. I have to wait till a movie ends (lol)..but not a issue... Display: samsung done great job in the display amoled .. punchy colors and clarity.. it's too good... Build: for making a budget mid ranger from a reputed brand .. plastic build is acceptable... it get scratches so better use protection... Camera: I expected this camera has equivalent to realme xt or vivo x pro.. but samsung made us very disappointment with the camera.. this tri camera makes device look but camera have to improve much much ... low light its performing some times decent.. normal pictures are looks like very low pixelated... like an 5mp cam.. this may be fix from software updates.. expecting better update... else this phone can't beat its competitors.. with just 6000 battery.. against their in display fp and camera competitions.. Good luck samsung.. Over all a budget phone .. my suggestion is do you want good display and battery and useful one ui features with samsung brand just go for. It else just wait for till a update to recover their camera clarity ...,positive

This is incorrect - it is not preregistered to your account - you have to login and setup the device. Not really a big deal as it takes only a few minutes, but amazon could've taken care to not make claims that aren't true. second, whats the point of having an extensive library of apps if you're going to cripple the storage to a measly 8 GB? I mean it's not like storage is prohibitively expensive. it could've been quite reasonable to put in 32-64 GB of storage so that we don't have to worry about space constraints. stream quality is decent, plex is a miracle.",neutral

"I purchased fitbit versa in October 2018. I have worn it almost daily (and many times during night too). It has many features for giving fitness related stats. But its firmware is not bug free and gives incorrect readings of heart rate monitor, step counting, calorie counting etc. Few of the issues which I faced are: 1. Step counting - the device will not give correct step counting if you are travelling in a vehicle which experience jerks like a moving train. Once my step count was 9000 at around 3 am when I was sleeping on a train berth. It will register few steps when we move our arm. There is also an issue of wearing the device on dominant hand or non-dominant hand. 2. Storey count - If you travel by a two wheeler and drive over any flyover, it will register as storey count. Once I got storey count of more than 50 wherein actually it should have been 0. 3. Heart rate monitor - The device uses heart rate as basis to count calories. If this vital sensor works inaccurately, the calorie count will also give inaccurate results. From past few days, my versa device showed resting heart rate from 135 to 165 bpm while I was sitting. This is way way higher then actual resting heart rate of 65 to 85 bpm. Due to this inaccuracy my calorie count went to 7000+ everyday which was absurd. The company knows this bug for a long time now but they are not able to provide any solution to resolve it and are not allowing to replace or repair the device which are still in warranty. They asked me to wait and watch for resolution. I am afraid that my warranty will expire if I follow their advise after which they will not be legally bound to rectify the issue. Please avoid buying versa as its quality is not up to mark.",negative

Device looks and feels awesome in hand. Nice build quality. 90Hz refresh rate display is smooth. Rear camera module isn't that awkward as mentioned by many since we hardly see it. Camera performance is good though color difference is noticable when shifting between 3 cameras. There are few software glitches and bugs seen which are being fixed by updates. Still needs few updates to make the device bug free. Major down point is battery life which is not that great for continuous media consumption or gaming that too with 90Hz setting. But Warp charge comes as a savior. Delivery took its sweet time of 10 days which was a bummer.,positive

Being a lazy writer I never write review but this time I found this should be known to everyone including Amazon. I'll put the same is social media also. ****** I told I bought 2 phone, in first phone I have given all permission while configuring initial setup. Then I checked for any firmware / any system updates are required or not. There was no update. I recorded the version number. ******** Then I started configuring the 2nd phone. This was to be used for phone banking and credit card activity that's why I have restricted few permissions during initial setup. AND THEN I CHECKED 'SYSTEM UPDATE' SECTION.

Amazing smartphone. Super fast charger. Battery percentage reached 77% from 15% only in 26 mins. Thanks to Warp charging. The phone is super fast. I noticed a lot of difference from my previous phone (RN5 Pro) when it comes to paying using Paytm. The photos are coming really good. Especially the photos that are shot in low light. The camera app itself suggests - based on the environment -when we should use the Wide landscape option. The only con is the unavailability of head phone jack. I wish OnePlus had provided the Type-C to 3.5mm adapter in the phone's package. Otherwise it costs ₹390 in Oneplus stores. Just go for it if you're looking for an upgrade. I trust you won't regret.,positive
"This is really monster because battery consumption is less inspite of attending zoom video calls for one hour. Touchscreen is so smooth and instant response.

"I bought this phone to gift my dad. He is a businessman and have hobby of photography. 2 things which he really need in a phone is good camera quality and high battery life as he attends 50-60 calls in a day and heavy use of internet as well. He is using the phone from last 3 weeks approx. and he is quite happy with the phone picture quality as he is able to send lot of his product image to his customer sitting in different cities and able to use the phone whole day in a single charge, That's what he needed! Great phone in reasonable price.",positive

It was shipped early and arrived a day earlier than I was expecting. The shipment was secure and I received an OTP on the day of delivery. Always nice to wrap the package under a secured delivery!

Excellent device if your needs are content consuming apps (news / email / phone / feeds / etc ..).,positive

"I have recently ordered iPhone for my cousin and you can find below my review on the product based on a weeks usage. I will update this again after a month of use. Personally i have been a iPhone user for a long time now and yes i use Android phones also, because i am an app developer. iPhone X Pros - Size and design, iPhone X is an unbelievably designed device, that feels so sleek and handy. It is slightly larger than iPhone 8 but smaller than iPhone 8 S. I have attached images taken from Apple store for comparison. - Camera - It has the best ever camera on an iPhone. I said on iPhone, because there are devices like Pixel 2, Mi 8 , Huawei P20 Pro that comes with half the price of iPhone x and better camera. - Shooting videos - I have always noticed that iPhone offers an edge in video quality over other phones of similar specs - Waterproof - iPhone X is rated IP67. A lot of people lose their phones due to water damage. Sometimes, an iphone can save you from buying a new phone, which is a kind of cost saving. Especially if you spend a lot of time in pool, outdoor activities this might be a boon. Also you can shoot a lot of underground videos. Cons - Costly, yes iPhone X comes at a very premium price. It's a phone made for high class category only - If you are looking for best camera phone, go for something else. You can get a Pixel 2, Mi8 , or P20 for less than half price. These phones have better Dxomark scores than iPhoneX. Head on to Dxo Mark website and check. Being an iPhone user for a long time, i would also like to list a few cons and pros of using iPhone compared to Android iPhone Pros - If you have a mac, iPhone can work seamlessly with mac. The same apps are available for mac and iPhone which syncs seamlessly. Calendar, TODOs, Notes, Contacts etc helps me a lot. I add a todo from my mac and next moment i have it on my phone too. That works great. - If you are someone who is hooked up to mac always, you can easily attend your calls on mac ig both devices are on same network. I have found this really helpful - Apple makes the best non bud type earphones in my experience. Personally i do not like in ear canal earphones as they can impair hearing. I have found no other good alternatives to Apple earphones in terms of audio clarity. But yes you can get better over the ear or in canal earphones. - Physical button for silent mode - Yes, thats a quick and comfy shortcut to turn your phone silent even without unlocking it/turning screen on. If you are a person who attends a lot of meetings and requires to turn phone silent, this can be quite helpful. You can quickly check the button position and say your phone is silent or not. iPhone Cons - Accessories are costly - If you need to buy an extra cable(maybe for office) or adapter, you need to shell somewhere between 1500 to 2500 bucks. Chinese accessories won't work well and perfect with iPhone - iOS is buggy at times. I have to admit that. Not just that, apple bug fixing is very slow compared to Googles Android - Apple music is slighly costly comapred to Google music - 120 rs per month If you are looking for cheaper alternatives, i would suggest you the Google Pixel 2. Google pixel comes with Unlimited Original quality photo and video storage. On iPhone, for the same thing you have to shell out additional 75INR per month for 50 GB. For higher storage you need to pay more. If you are a person who shoots a lot of videos, Googles Unlimited storage can save you a lot of money. However you can install Google photos and get Unlimited Normal backup for photos and videos on any iOS/Android phone, where Google converts the files to reduce quality. For images, its quite ok, the difference is barely noticeable, but for videos yes , they convert it to One-fourth the size.",positive

"The picture quality is really good but lacks right amount of refresh rate for playing UHD videos, although it is a UHD certified 4K TV. The sound output is nice but amplification at some instances is required for appropriate audibility. The TV goes into loop startup sometimes where it won't start even if you keep pushing the power button, this problem seemed to resolve by it's own if you wait for few more seconds. I'm not sure whether it happened with the others but I get screen blink (during loop) after pushing the power button just like when the TV was trying to power up it's display but the power cuts off. Hope the review helps others. Thanks for spending your time reading this.",positive

On paper, the screen resolution is HD+, but being AMOLED it doesn't seems to matter much. The battery stays for around 2 days with regular usage.

"For 15k the phone is a great deal, with 6.5 inches screen, 20MP+2MP rear camera and a 16MP front camera along with a 3750mAH battery, it's a total package. But what is the use of such great specs with not so great performance? The camera works fine under daylight situations only with the AI mode enabled and during the night it shoots pictures like an 8MP camera. Next, the speaker is something which I didn't expect, it literally plays 320kbps song as if it is playing a low-quality audio file. The battery output of this is good, and the display is vivid and bright for streaming. It is a huge package with limited functionalities.

"So, I bought MacBook Air 2017 finally, like after 6 to 7 months of introspection. September, 21 2017 2:00 AM I placed the order, the Great Indian E-comm competition benefited me immensely. Flipkart and Amazon contested aggressively during the wee ours of 21 September. Price of MacBook Air dropped from 57K to 50.. then 47 … 45..44. After observing this price war for 30 to 40 mins. I made sure to order it when the price hit the lower circuit. Like people traded on Stock Exchange right after the opening bell, I was waiting for the price to drop and hit that order button. Around 2 AM I was sure 42 was the best price I could get it for. Though it could drop further, I didn’t want to let go this opportunity, and finally did the transaction. Coming to the user experience, believe me this is one of the best you can get at this price. Every penny is worth. Build quality, touch pad, OS, shortcuts, brink of an eye boot up and the forever battery will mesmerise you. This machine captivates you at every instance you use it, they have put so much in designing the OS and its feature. Also, the size of the machine is a wonder in itself.",positive

"The M30 has a class-leading screen, which comes with the added benefit of further improved battery life - again to levels no competitor can match. The Galaxy M30 is great all-rounder and makes a very compelling case for someone who doesn't find 3D gaming or camera performance particularly important. You still get to enjoy a very nice display and the outstanding battery life. Pros Exceptional battery life, okay charging speed. One of the best displays you can have in the segment. An ultra wide camera is hard to find in this class. Good portraits, really nice selfies. Dedicated microSD slot. Cons Plasticky build. Unexciting image quality from the rear cameras. No 4K recording even though the chipset supports it; no stabilization in 1080p either. You can get a more powerful chipset at this price point.",positive
"Awesome camera below 1lakh. Since its the latest in the canon lineup it has all features for basic/mid level DSLR enthusiast. Once you master you can go for Canon 5D Mark IV that will be released in near furture. I my opinion its better to go for this instead of basic DSLR's and you can either keep it with you for long time incase if you dont want to update to any expensive camera or or you learn alot and then update.

Honestly speaking... It's a great device. Camera is one of the main highlight of this device. And the wrap charge 30T is extremely fast. It charge the phone in an hour. But there is only one issue that I am facing is raise to wake and tap to wake is working properly in my device. Means sometimes it's working and sometimes it's not. The issue for this is I've press the power button then only I am able to unlock the screen. I hope this issue will get resolved in near future.,positive

"NOTE: @ This is detailed comparison between iPhone 8, X, XS & XR, after using each of them for a month. @ I am also stating the detailed battery performance of each phone. This is a long review, but its worth if you willing to spend your hard earned money. BUILT QUALITY : -------------------- # iphone 8 and XR have glass front and back, ringed with metal frames (aluminum), which looks more premium and worth the price you pay. But also are susceptible to easy damages. # iphone X and XS are made of stainless steel, which don't appears that luxurious comparatively, but are more sturdier and less prone to damage compared to 8 and XR. # Among all iphone 8 is lightest and XR heaviest, with X and XS being almost similarly weighed. # To me in this parameter, iphone 8 seems the better choice. DISPLAY : ----------- # iphone 8 has smallest display(4.7"") and XR the biggest(6.1""), with X and XS with same size(5.8""), so is the screen to body ratio. # Display resolution of X and XS is same and the best amongst all, while 8 and XR is same and lowest ( NOT even FHD ). Similarly, X & XS have OLED, while 8 & XR have LCD :P # According to my usage I found X & XS to be much better value for money in terms of display quality. SYSTEM PERFORMANCE : ----------------------------- # I noticed XS performing slightly better than XR, though both of them have same processor. Followed by X and 8. # If you are normal user like me then you wont mind using iphone 8 over XS, as 8 can do everything that XS can easily. # I found X to be better value for money in this segment. BATTERY PERFORMANCE : ------------------------------ # All 4 phones are equipped with fast charging, wireless charging. # XR use to last over 20 hours with normal multitasking, with 4G ON continuously all the time. *XS use to last between 16-18 hours, X did 14-15 hours and 8 use to lasts upto 12 hours. # With Heavy multitasking, XR lasted over 11 hours, XS did over 9 hours, X lasted over 8 hours and 8 lasted upto 6 hours. # Certainly XR outshines others in battery performance. CAMERA : ----------- # In this segment, I noticed iphone X to be the best among all when using Rear camera. * Colours are more punchy and true to real. Night time photography is also excellent. # XS sometimes does better over X, but not always. # Front camera of X, XS and XR are same and performs almost similarly. # Each one supports 4K, OIS, slow motion. PRICE (64GB) : --------------- 8 - Rs.55K X - Rs.75K XR - Rs.77k XS - Rs.99K # Here certainly 8 is winner :P P.S: you get a physical home button on iphone 8, which certainly comes handy. VERDICT : ----------- After using each phone, I can conclude that if you are tight on budget then going for iphone 8 is best choice. If you have 80k to spare, then certainly go for iphone X. And if budget is not in your dictionary, then certainly go for iphone XS. To me iphone XR is not worth the price at all, except the battery performance, it doesn't have any noticeable parameter. If you already own a iphone 7, then don't upgrade unless, you have money to waste. If you have 6s or below, then only go for upgrade. Hope this review helps.",neutral

"It’s unbelievable that this phone is made by Xiaomi. - One of the poor displays I’ve seen. The pixels are so obviously visible. - The finger print sensor is too slow. I’d rather be happy with a faster off-screen finger print sensor. - No fast charger inside box, unlike Realme 5 pro, which is better than Mi A3 in all aspects. - Camera is not bad. Asus Max Pro M2 camera is so top notch for that price. Can’t believe that companies are still pulling off stunts talking Megapixel terms. Only significant pro so far IMO is that this is an Android One phone. Luckily no Xiaomi bloatware. However, I was flabbergasted to find “Mi Services” in settings, which allows to send data to Xiaomi servers.",neutral

"1. The display quality is just fabulous 2. The One UI is just amazing with lots of awesome features like night mode, blue light filter etc. The UFS 2.1 makes it very easy to open any apps in fraction of seconds 3. Camera is above average in day light and average in low light. 4. Sound quality is decent. It is not loud enough, but the clarity is crystal clear. Sound output through 3 mm jack s also very good. 5. The RAM management is very nice compared to other phones in this price segment. 6. 6000 MAH battery is very good, but Exynos 9611 processor needs more optimization. For normal usage, it might come upto one and a half day and for a heavy user, it might come for one day strictly. Screen on Time is between 6.5 to 8 hours. 7. There is no heating issue when you are in call or normal internet usage, but when you use camera or OLA or Uber continuously for 20 mins, the phone heats up. 8. The call quality is very good. No call drops. If Samsung fixes the issue of battery draining and heating issue in an update, this device would be really awesome. Overall Samsung Galaxy M30s is a very good phone with lots of features in this price segment.",positive

However, I am quite disappointed with the camera, though even using triple camera the quality not at par, it produces grains in low light as well as the effect of selfie-cam and main camera is not very effective. There are other phone which is providing good results, even in the lesser camera configuration. Though, I trust Vivo as a brand is good would really ensure to upgrade the software and application of the camera in the next software upgrade.

"Hello, I'm a casual nature photographer and here is my quick review on Nikon D5300. I started my photography hobby with Nikon D3200 and got familiar in a month. Its the best dslr camera for beginners to get started into photography field. Meanwhile I bought two lenses, Nikon AF-S 55-200mm for bird photography and AF-S 35mm for general photography. Both of these lenses are good and sharp. After 2 years, I felt the need of upgrade because D3200 had some lacking features as given below and 200mm was short for bird photography. I sold it last month and bought this Nikon D5300 Dual Lens Kit from JJ Mehta. This is a wonderful camera and fulfills all my present requirements. It feels sturdy in hands and buttons are easy to operate. UI is user friendly and straightforward. Screen is slightly warmer but pleasant to view photos in the day and night. Compared to my previous dslr, this one has improved image sensor, 2,016 pixels exposure metering sensor, 4800DX AF system, EXPEED 4 image processor, no AA filter, lesser shutter lag and etc. Hence its more powerful and takes much better photos. Nikon AF-P 18-55mm and 70-300mm lenses take sharp photos from end to end focal length and wide open. The new AF-P technology is very fast in focusing, accurate and silent. Also there was no issues focusing in low light situations whereas my other AF-S lenses struggle big time. The focus ring is electronic so its very smooth and precise but only works when the camera is ON. In other words, focus ring is connected to AF motor and that moves the lens elements. Unfortunately both the lenses have different filter size (55mm and 58mm respectively) so I had to buy two different size MC-UV filters for them. Here is the list of features that I find very helpful and the same were lacking in D3200. 1. Framing grid in viewfinder. Helpful for products photography. 2. Auto ISO display in viewfinder. ISO sensitivity can be seen in viewfinder before the taking shot. 3. 39 AF points, 9 of them are cross type. With AF-P lens, its superfast and accurate. 4. Wide range of ISO sensitivity selection. i.e 100, 125, 160, 200, 250 & so on. 5. Adjustable compensation values for minimum shutter speed in Auto ISO. i.e Slower, slow, normal, fast, faster. 6. Low and high continuous release modes. Helpful for bird photography. 7. Give rating for photos within the camera. 8. Custom my menu list. I can add useful settings in that list so I don't have to search in main list. 9. Built-in Wifi. I can use qDslrDashboard app to take photos from my smartphone without a wire connection. Tested and works fine. 10. Last but not least, the articulated screen. I'm not really a fan of it but it is indeed helpful sometimes. Finally, I would highly recommend this camera to amateur photographers. Even beginners can go for it instead of D3XXX so there is no need to upgrade early.",positive
"Using this for he past two months- the sound is balanced with adequate lows, mids and highs. While the bass is ok for normal listeners, don’t expect much if you are a bass head. Wished a better version of Bluetooth was given for more seamless experience; it sometimes losses connection when the mobile is in pocket. Overall, a good buy at this price point",positive

"Dissapointing phone!! Graduated from onleplus7 to 7T in just 2months but its been 3 weeks and the expirience with 7T has been really very poor and frustrating. Major Issue- the phone has a major display issue which comes into notice in the 2nd week. 1. ""Tap to Wake"" function doesn't work most of the times. You will have to press the power button to wake up the phone. 2. The ""Ambient Display"" function wherein the phone wakes up upon picking it up also doesn't work 80% of the time. REALLY FRUSTRATING No worth 40k price tag just for a Big screen and 3cameras. I doubt if d screen wud work for 1year also. Oneplus should come with solution if they actually care for Indian customers. Waste of Money",negative

"After using windows laptops from almost 6 years I bought this machine. Initially it was hard to get used to the MacBook OS and it's features but trust me, after using it for a week you'll fall in love with MacBook. Pros: 1. Sound Quality is really clear and good. 2. Battery life is amazing, I use it daily for almost 2-4 hrs and I charge it only once in 2-3 days. 3. Finger gestures are amazing. 4. Speed ❤️. No lags whatsoever. Cons: 1. Apple should have updated the 2017 MacBook with Retina display, although this display is works perfectly fine. 2. To use some applications, you've to buy them. Can not use cracked version unlike windows. If you're looking for a laptop (non-gaming) within 50-60k budget which you want to use it for long term, buy this one.",positive

I have 2 other powerbanks with me (Mi 10000mah & anker power core+ 10000mah). Back in 2015 i paid like 3500rs for the anker one just to get quick charge 2.0. But now we can get mi 10000mah with two way quickcharge for just 800rs. With that being said the anker one is way more durable as normally the mi one's starts to show problems in an year (my anker is working fine for the last 4 years and i have changed 3 secondary powerbanks in this timeframe). Compared to the mi 10k powerbank i think for most of the people the 10k will be the better choice. Because 1️⃣ The mi 10k have metal casing and this ome is plastic 2️⃣. Mi 10k is slimmer hence easier to hold in hand and carry in the pocket (it less than half thick as you can see from the images) 3️⃣. The price is 1400 compared to 800 of mi 10k so the price is only 200rs less compered to 2 mi 10k's 4️⃣. Most probably its going to die in 1-1.5 years (based on my experience) irrespective of wether it is 10k or 20k I knew all these but still i brought this one because 1️⃣. I need the 20k capacity. I have gadgets that works 24/7 with usb power 2️⃣. This one have more base area so it will stay on the surface when placed vertically over the thin mi 10k If these two point's don't matter i think mi 10k will be better for you,positive
This is a very poor quality phone. It switches off at random and dials number at random. The flash light comes on automatically and it is a struggle to switch it off as the screen gets unresponsive. It was a big mistake buying this phone. Camera quality is also very average.,negative

So please don't post the reviews without giving phone proper use time. I love my haptic vibrator, due to that I want to tyyyyyype more on the keyboard. Screen colour reproduction is excellent 🤩,on par with Samsung and even better in some areas(read Android authority review about screen). And 90 hz don't read about it ,experience it Dual speakers are awesome 😍 Cameras are miles ahead than my previous OnePlus 5, that's enough for me Android 10 gestures are awesome (copy from iPhone gestures) Light blue colour is excellent in person which was average in images. When I waited for my phone to charge🙄,it was that fast and cool. Once go to OnePlus you will never comeback. It's not about features,it's about experience.",positive

Nice looks with full screen display. Plastic back, I purchased it because I hate glass back panel, they crack on single drop. Fast face unlock and finger print sensor. Decent camera with stickers. Super network signal, it also changes the data network very fast from one sim to another in a second, my previous phone was taking a minute to do so. Build quality is nice, you feel it in hand. UI is fast and simple. Cons: Finger print sensor should lock the phone also, my moto x was doing it. Face unlock is unlocking the phone with eyes closed, very bad. Camera is not so good in very low light Hope Samsung solves above problems with software update. Pros are many more than minor cons. In short, I can recommend this phone.",positive

Yet it says ita 720p screen, but trst me, ive used 3k screen on Lg g7, this one is much better. Its same like a 4k tv with a crappy panel vs FHD tv with a top notch panel.

Speed- u can not match it with apple or other high end phone, but in this range u can't have better than this. Simply one of the best in this bracket. Camera- will not disappoint u. One of the best in distance and close shots. Sound- quality could have been better, though loaded with Dolby atmos. This can be overcome by using a good earphone as it's not supplied with phone. Overall- it's body has metal finish, which gives rich feel, but it doesn't matter much as people are using back cover.",positive

Captured pictures have low quality. But speed of the phone is impressive. Looking great .I m using a sm glxy j2 16 . It has a much good pic. Quality.

"Always a pleasure to use an iPhone, smooth and sexy as always. But when Apple will invest on the accessories like charger and earphone quality??? Pathetic... it lasts just for 7-8 months.

"I bought this in October 2017. I got it at an amazing price. It was last year's flagship at that time and I couldn't have been happier. I was used to phones from Xiaomi at that point so I was looking forward to exploring this. I already had a Macbook Air and this made perfect sense. 2017: Love at first sight I was blown away by the performance of the device. It just works perfectly; there is no lag; the camera is just awesome and takes perfect pictures and the video quality is just amazing! The sound quality via headphones is one of the best I have heard and the dual speakers works wonders! The battery life is also decent; I was expecting very bad battery life but it is good, it last 1 and half days which is awesome for such a thin and light phone. 2018: The cracks start to appear The phone is performing perfectly. I can see using it till at least 2021. It is still a beast; I don't play many games but it does the trick; however there are some nuances: 1. I got a 32 GB version of the phone which got filled really fast and iCloud only allows 5 GB so I had to upgrade. It was only Rs 75/- per month for 50 GB so its fine. 2. I can't download music without iTunes and it is pretty annoying. I made my own song and cannot load it on my phone. I have 2 computers, a Macbook Air and a desktop. I can't import music from the desktop as it is locked to my MAC. My MAC is having issues of it's own which means I can't load music to my phone without losing whatever is already there. This is beyond stupid. 3. I can't turn off bluetooth or wifi. Turning it off via the quick toggle disconnects it and doesn't turn it off. Why would anyone want to just disconnect without turning it off? 4. The lightning cable broke. I ordered a replacement and it didn't work after a few days. Turns out you need an apple certified cable which costs over Rs 500 (at least); so that's more money down the drain. 5. I bought apple music which costs Rs 120 permonth as it is easier to attach a damn cable everytime I want new music. I know I can do it wirelessly but I would prefer doing it without a computer. It is a smartphone; should it be able to just add music to my music play list? 6. I don't know what Apple did but the battery life is now horrible. I bought Baseus 5000 mAH charging case and my phone feels like a brick now. Still worth it as it runs for 3 days straight! 7. I can't seem to take pictures in 16:9 aspect ratio. The camera app doesn't have that option. 8. Youtube just punishes apple devices; every other video I play will always have an ad. I have an android phone as well and I only get ads may be once every 5 videos.I am using the same account on both devices. 9. I removed apps like Amazon, Flipkart and stuff; it just eats space and I only have 32 GB. 10. The lightning to 3.5 mm adapter got lost. :( So I had to buy another one for Rs 900! The apple wired earphones sound very bad compared to my Sennheiser 275s. Next time I will buy a phone with a headphone jack. 11. I tried using a wireless earphone. Problem is everytime I have to unpair it from one of my phones to connect to the other one. Then again, I have to unpair it from my phone to connect to my Mac. My PC doesn't have bluetooth so I have to use a wired headphone there. Also battery life drains very fast when I use bluetooth on my iPhone and now I have to keep charging my bluetooth headphone which has a micro USB cable. Great!. So I am carrying a Lightning cable, a USB type C cable for my android phone, a micro USB cable, a 3.5 mm headphone, USB type C to 3.5 mm (because I did not learn the lesson the first time) and a lightning to 3.5 mm headphone. Perfect! 12. I am still happy with the performance of the phone though. Still no lag, feels like new. 2019: Never going back to iPhone (most likely) 1. I spent around Rs 200 every month on iCloud 50 GB and apple music every month. In a year I spent over Rs 2400/- I bought the battery case for Rs 5500/- and it has stopped working because the lightning adapter in the battery case stopped working. I bought a lightning to USB cable for 625/- and another one which did not work after a few days for 150/-. Taking into account screen protectors, cases, etc. I have spend almost Rs 10,000/- on things which were not factored into the cost of the phone. I am not including the bluetooth headset because I use it generally and is not specific for the phone. 2. Apple has slowed down my phone or has done something to it as it is not as snappy as it was. 3. The battery life is horrible. I went trekking a took a lot of pictures and in the morning it was 100% by 12 pm it was 5% and then it powered off. Of course I did not take continuous pictures. Around 100 or so pictures, and a couple of videos (totalling about ) 15 mins of videos. 4. My earpiece has stopped working and I have to almost shove the phone down my ear and so I use speakers for calls everytime. It will cost Rs 3500/- to fix.",neutral

"I have had extremely bad experiences with Apple products, they suffer from a chronic problem which is well known : overheating The operating temperature for Apple laptops aren't designed for 30 degree C weather. Every Apple laptop I've had has died in the Summer. several times in a year. and each time due to a component bust due to heat. It just wasn't designed with heat dissipation in mind. What's worse is that the Apple service center try to cheat you out of your warranty by blaming you of liquid spills. (Even if the LCIs aren't busted.) I got a wind of this scam when I disassembled the laptop, took pictures of the PCB and escalated it after spending hours on the crappy customer services lines. The Apple service center in two cities even tried to charge me to take a look when the laptop was under warranty! The whole experience was despicable. It's just not worth the stress and wasted hours dealing with incompetent Apple ""Geniuses"".",negative

"Unless you are getting it cheap in sale, there is no sense in purchasing Band 4 Running Edition for Rs 1600 when you can get MI Band 3 for 300 bucks extra. With MI band you get heart rate monitor and option to change watch face. Honor Band 4 is quite accurate in tracking activity, but then so is MI Bands. Problem with Honor Band 4 is that it comes with only one face, no option to change default watch style. Secondly it uses military time, with no option to use 12 hours time format. For Rs 1600, you expect these basic functions to be available. Better donate your money than buying this for Rs 1600. At least you will feel good and not cheated. My verdict - dont go for it. Mi Band is much better option. Even HRX Edition of MI band which is cheaper by Rs 300 is better option.",negative

"Seems there are major software issues with this phone. Which is not acceptable after considering that the phone has had 2 major updates (including Android Pie), so plenty of time to fix. Google Play had issues with: - Error 495 randomly while updating or installing apps - Clear data/cache does not work every time. - More than once, download stalled with message ""Waiting for wifi"" while the phone was clearly on an active wifi connection Stock Android should mean 'clean with no bloat', but here it means that many essential apps/settings are also missing from the phone. It seems to me that MI does not want this phone to get too popular otherwise their data syncing redmi phones won't sell any more. How else could one explain these software lapses, plus the fact that a 3000 mAh battery is unheard of in this price range, it should have been at least 3300, or that the phone supports quick charge, but they save Rs. 150/- and bundle a slower charger?",neutral

"I have received on 1st Oct, after being used for 10 days I am writing my review with pros and cons. Which may useful to decide to buy or not Pros: 1. Display amazing 2. Watched a movie with Dolby sound it's really awesome. So music experience also good 3. Sound (ring tone) audible 4.Battery is 6000 mah but not powerful as m30 of 5000 mah, but ok serve purpose of 1.5 day. 5. Powerful processor, so far didn't observe lags may be need to load apps. After that I can edit this review. 6. Both the sim slots support VOLTE, so one can use JIO sims on both. Cons: 1. Signal receiving very bad. I have honor 7x, placing side by side. This is worst in signal reciving. Due to this call drop happen almost every time even if you stand right behind call tower. I don't know it can be fixed later with patch. I feel this most important factor for mobile purchase. If it doesn't serve very basic need then it is waste of money. Rating 3 star. 3. Lot of bloatware which user doesn't not need. Most of apps doesn't have permission to delete. I think Samsung needs to improve on Primary Network issues",neutral

"This is the phone to go for. I have a jet black 128 GB spec. Talking about looks- it just nails every single aspect as for look is concerned. Very sleek design and stands out when you compare with other rivals. Performance- it works without hiccups and and touch is so graceful. 3 GB RAM seems like 6 GB. I have loaded my iPhone with lots of apps and high end games like nfs no limits, Asphalt8 etc and it works so smooth and the graphic qualities are unmatchable with any other. Camera - truly mind blowing image quality and portrait mode is what I loved the most. It like a pocket Dslr camera. Battery- I run my phone with mobile data and location switched on throughout the day, but 2900mah battery is quite outstanding. Can last for a day without any trouble. But only draw back I can point is charging time - needs full 2 hrs if you don't use ur phone. If you keep using it even while charging, time just exceeds 2 hrs. Overall- it is worth the money you pay. I am a proud owner of iPhone 7 plus.",positive

"Lacks a bit of Power and Crispiness. Meant only for silent rooms and 'light' listening. Driver produces good bass but could use a lil extra highs. Size is small, so lack of power can be expected. Being a music producer, these are my views. Its still good for music, but can't perform well on movies until n unless u have a 100% silent room. Not tried yet, but I think it would be hard put to use it as the source of sound for more than a person or two, as sometimes, if the room has noise (just the usual ambient noise of nearby roads, AC Fan etc.), you really have to put it close to your person in order to listen clearly.",neutral

"This review is mainly for the people who are buying this for 6000mah battery and a 48mp camera. I had a Redmi 3S Prime which had a 4000mah battery with 5 inch screen at 720p resolution which lasted for around 1.5 - 2 days when it was new. This one has a 6000mah battery with 6.4 inch screen at FHD+ resolution, faster processor, higher resolution camera and far more sensors than the 3s. So it won't last as good as the Redmi 3s Prime. The phone will last for 1-1.5 days depending on the usage. Camera quality is just about average but with some good features. Almost all the phones of Samsung have SuperAMOLED display these days so that's also a plus point. 6000mah battery is a necessity in phones with above 6inch screen(FHD+). One UI is not as feature rich as MIUI but has better quality than MIUI. People are easily misleaded by the self proclaimed 'GYAANIs' on youtube these days.",positive

This is the most subtle review. (Keeping Realme 5 pro in mind i.e. if 5/5 means equal to Realme 5 pro or 2/5 means much poor than Realme 5 pro.) Battery - 5/5 Processor - 4/5 Camera - 2/5 Screen Color Quality - 3/5 Size and Look - 4/5 Microphone - 5/5 Speaker - 5/5 Call Recording - Yes Camera is it's biggest failure. As everyone saying Your 48mp will be just 13mp. Front Camera is also not satisfying. Picture colour and Face clarity don't look standard. Though given ppi density much good still screen colors aren't satisfying. Exynos-9611 (Mera) has lower antutu score than Snapdragon-712(Realme 5pro) Heating Issue upper side near camera by just simply using it. And last as already mentioned in other reviews Length is more in comparison to width. Look ugly.,neutral

"Amazon delivered the product 2 days late even after me being a prime customer so that cost the product 0.5 on the star scale. Coming to the product, it is a good choice for the price range. It has a decent camera(s). The processor is fast and responsive. Fast face recognition, good image stability and low light photography is decent with a few glitches. There is a minor heating issue at times. The only negative is the battery life. I have used a phone with 5000 mAH before. It stayed way longer than M30 without the need for charging it. To be precise with this huge a battery size that Samsung claims the performance is not as great as it should be. You will need to charge the battery twice a day with moderate use and no gaming. If you are to use it for PUBG you'll need to charge it more than twice a day. The picture and sound quality are decent as well but Dolby Atmos for sound works only with headphones or a bluetooth speaker. I also experienced a slower internet speed with this phone and network issues. All these cost the product a star. I have written this review after using the phone for over a week.",neutral

Processor: 5 out of 5 Provide you good speed in terms of application accessibility. Sound: fair enough Display: 5 out of 5 It really surprise you that the display is quite smooth Delivery: 5 out of 5 I got this item within 2 hours. Amazing delivery by Amazon Prime Now.

First impression of laptop was perfect. 1.Starting time or boot time is just 6 to 8 second which is really amazing! 2. Display is very nice with bright colours. 3. Speed of laptop is nice. 4. i5 9th gen prosser get all task smoothly and fast. 5. Nvdia graphics 1650 are very good and in high graphics setting it works fluent 6. Cooling system is very nice with centre cooling, cooling system works in effective manner if you use it on table or horizontal surface then it doesn't heat any other part. Fans don't make much noise. 7. Sound are also nice. 8. Good standard and premium look makes it different from other gaming laptop 9. Good for high graphics software. 10. 512 gb ssd is totally awesome every thing you run will be 10 times faster, similar kind of speed like i7 9th gen in its hdd. Very nice laptop. Must buy and try 512 gb ssd because that makes it perfect!!",positive

You can't keep your watch and phone together and Bluetooth switched on perpetually. Am using a Honor 8x running Android 8. Later read it's a common issue with Versa and Huawei phones.

Very bad experience with Samsung again with the smart phones. Its totally unexpectable experience. I have purchased this phone in mid February and its mid August now and phone screen got damaged without any physical contact. Screen is not working properly. Have asked the problem to Samsung care but the solutions they have suggested is not fulfill my expectations. They have suggested to visit Samsung care stores for the same. And i am sure after visiting there the store guy will ask you for the high money for the replacement and all and they will blames to the customers only. I don't know why Samsung is making smart phones if they can't make a good one. I would like to request kindly return my phone please. I don't want this any more now.,negative

For a younger generation who anyway purchase subscriptions like Netflix and Amazon Prime, this is a great option to stream content. I'm using it on an old LCD TV and works perfectly like a dream! Only thing is, it was unable to pair the volume control to control the TV, but that's a really tiny thing compared to how awesome this device is. It's giving some really tough competition to Apple TV and Google Chromecast.",positive

"I bought this for casual portable listening and carrying around to various rooms in house or office. After reading many negative reviews about the possibility of a fake product I was initially apprehensive about my purchase and regretted going after the Lightening deal discount rather than from a trustworthy store retailer. So I immediately put it to test. One plug option was not in packet so it looked as if it was opened earlier. But the actual player looked untouched. Setup of the player is fairly easy and straightforward forward. Only complaint is that Bose hasn't given a mobile app to control the device. I earlier had an awesome Yamaha soundbar which could have different settings for sound output thru app, which is a nice feature. Connecting to Bluetooth is instant and range of connectivity is good too. I tested till around 25 feet. I consider myself as music aficionado, having great quality music systems and headphones for over a decade. Hence, biggest apprehension was sound quality but Bose turned out to be Bose in this regard. Lows as well as highs are clearly distinguishable. No crackling at highest volume of bass. Treble is equally awesome. It took around 2 hours to charge it initially while playing music and running fine since then. I don't think there will be any problem in attaining close to 10 hours of battery life. An expensive proposition for a non waterproof device but completely satisfied with Bose quality so far. Enjoy the music.",positive

"First of all got it for 38000. Great at this price but or maximum at 45k nothing more than that for this phone. Pros: 1. Great battery life: When you are not using your phone battery doesn't goes down even 1% that is phenomenal. 2. A12 bionic: The processor is super quick doesn't lag at all and performance is top notch. No phone other than latest iphone can match that performance. 3. Camera: great click even though it's only a single camera. 4. Design: No chin and that is great. Weight of phone seems perfect when you hold it. 5. Haptic vibration: It may seems a small thing but when you it comes into play it makes your experience just super fulfilling. Very satisfying vibrations and no other phone except oneplus7t has it. 6. Os: super easy to use. 7. Dual sim: after sometime yes iphones can be used as dual sim port but has only one sim slot other sim will be used as esim offered only by jio and airtel. Cons: 1. Display: Flagship phone with no 1080p display is seriously disappointing. 2. Charger: No fast charger in the box. 3. Notch: Very big notch looks very bad at times. 4. Single camera: It takes good photos but iphone with dual camera is just phenomenal. Camera is good but not great. Final verdict: If you hate lags, not in a hurry to charge the phone, can neglect notch and not very much into camera usage then this is the phone for you. Display is not a very big problem as its the same display of iphone8 and notch can be neglected. Now you can make your choice. But a great phone to buy",positive

"This day 1 review of the phone about the look and feel only.I bought the opal black 4gb variant and was delivered yesterday. To my surprise the marketing team has done a fantastic job in promotion but it is in sharp contrast to the manufacturing. Pros: 1. Fast Charger 2. I got it for 11500 which is suitable for this kind of phone. Cons: 1. The phone is very heavy and bulky. 2. There is no basic phone cover available inbox. 3. Back side is prone to finger prints and scratches, so you go and buy a cover first. 4. The screen is marketed as Super AMOLED however it is HD+ at best. 5. if you compare with A70's Super AMOLED screen M30s stands nowhere (so false marketing) 6. Main camera is marked as 48MP however it is 12-16MP at best. 7. Front camera also fails to impress. 8. Added a new contact, it took 2-3 seconds for the name to appear on the contact number after being saved. 9. Read another review which said the user observed less network towers on his M30s when he was in full network coverage area as shown by other phones. 10. Point 9 is true, i also observed the less network coverage with this phone. Overall this phone has failed to impress on almost every front. Overall it not as per the expectations i had based on the feature mentioned for the phone.",negative

"This is an excellent Phablet (yes, it's a tablet + phone, hence Phablet). I have been using this on and off for almost 6 months. Actually, a friend of mine owns it, but I keep borrowing it from him from time-to-time for multimedia usage. This is a beast when it comes to performance. With Snapdragon 625 processor, 4 GB RAM, Full HD 8 inch display, 64 GB storage, a 4850mAH battery and a clean Android Nougat UI this delivers a smooth performance. It's great gaming and multimedia. The performance is top notch. Design-wise, it's build sleek with premium glass body and the beautiful screen adds to the beauty. While it comes with Android Nougat out of the box but I read online that this Tab will get Oreo update in future. Either ways (Nougat/Oreo), this is configured to deliver great performance for over 3 years. No bloatware/apps, except for ShareIT and a couple of Lenovo apps which can be uninstalled if one doesn't like to use. Battery back up is very good. On a full charge it lasted over a day with moderate to heavy usage. Sound quality is also excellent. Sound quality is much better if you use good quality Headphones, especially Bluetooth, because it has Dolby Atmos built-in. Call quality is also good. A very useful feature is it supports dual 4G standby, which is great. I'm not sure about VoLTE or Jio since I didn't use with JIO. But no issues with 4G and Wi-Fi connectivity. The price of 22k is a bit high but still it's value for money, considering it packs great hardware, beautiful display and latest software. Please buy a decent case and apply a good quality tempered glass to protect the phone and it's display, since it's glass both sides. There is a 16 GB storage/3GB RAM option available on Flipkart for 17k, which has same built and delivers similar performance, but 16 GB internal storage is too low considering it will be used mainly for multimedia and gaming purposes. It's also a great option for those who spend a lot of time browsing, reading online, watching Youtube. Also, you'll never feel bored on a long journey, if you carry this Tablet along. Clearly, Lenovo has a winner with Lenovo Tab4 8 Plus Tablet and every buyer of this Tablet will be happy and proud of their purchase. Hope this helps :)",positive

"Without doubt M30s has the best display which is smooth to handle and fills your heart with joy. The 91% screen ratio is adorable. The 6000 mAh battery is the best thing that can happen to a phone and I can work 2 full days with my phone before I recharge. For a 6000 mAh battery, the phone is surely light weight. Although Samsung claims fast charging, it's still a little slow! 6000 mAh is big and this could be the reason. Although charging speed is not so great, it's adequate I would say. Another best part about the phone is that there is no crazy heating issues. Prolonged usage or charging does not make M30s a hot tava. Performance has been great, no hang ups or glitches. Looks like Samsung's Exynos 9611 is packed with some great stuff. A 48M pixel camera with depth and wide angle supporting cameras is an attractive combination. Although not the best camera, it's still great. All these at a price of Rs. 16,999/- is just incredible.",positive

Features like split screen, kids space (allow to run a list apps for kids for specified time), 100+ themes to change the look of UI, soft keys or swipe gesture (like iPhone X) for UI, Face unlock and finger print unlock is very fast, And the list goes on and on.... 4. Very good camera performance , it capture best in day light and does decent job in night. Options like portrait, bokeh, time lapse , slo-mo etc are as good as high end phones. 5. Battery is very good and battery related optimisations are in built with OS which gives lot of option to make battery life last longer 6. MediaTek processor is very good for games and other graphic content apps, LTE connectivity is good, could have been better with qualcomm processor but still existing chip does good job. 7. It’s a phone for every age, UI can be customised As per your taste. 8. Android 9 upgrade is available through software update. Cons Wifi is only 2.4ghz, there is no 5ghz available, I mean it’s not dual band wifi. That’s it, nothing else. If you are looking for sub 10k phone, no more confusion, this is the best phone out there.",positive

Battery life not so good,neutral
"I've been using my iPhone XR for over 10 months now. So far, everything's hunky-dory. While setting up the phone, you'll be asked to choose between passcode and Face ID. Choose the Face ID. It's makes your life much easier (having to punch in the passcode every single time you need to unlock the phone is very irritating, trust me!). iPhone XR's battery lasts much longer than iPhone 8's (which I exchanged for iPhone XR). Once fully charged, the battery lasts for around 2-3 days, assuming the phone is being used for approximately 2 hours/day for activities such as browsing facebook, instagram, reading Kindle e-books, listening to music (streaming as well as downloaded), and watching YouTube videos (for a couple of minutes). The notch is an interesting design choice made by Apple. Some apps like YouTube choose to hide it, others don't. But when you take into account the edge-to-edge display, and the sleek design, the notch seems to add to the beauty of the phone. Both the front & rear cameras are good. As far iOS 12 is concerned, it's better than iOS 11. It's less buggy, and loads & runs apps smoothly.",positive

Pretty good product. Loved it. It has a good sized screen. Plus the lights on the screen are better than the Redmi 4 I currently own. Night time selfie camera is a waste. Daytime pictures turn out to be nice. Video stabilization feature in particular is really nice. 2 months usage review - Video stabilization feature pleases till date. Processor is really powerful. 2 extremely minute scratches have developed on the screen because of my usage and the fact that I never put a screen guard. Plastic back cover that came with the phone is good and prevents slippage. So far... Phone is awesome!,positive

"NOTE: @ I am already using this Band since Last 2 month, so this review is Based on over 2 Month of heavy usage. @ SpO2 & Music control features are available via Firmware updates since 29/09/2019 *Music control feature can be used to Control the music of default as well as 3rd party apps. @ Straps of Honor band 4 also fit this Honor band 5 perfectly. @ Has awesome battery backup of 12+ days ( check the review for Detailed Battery backup ) @ You can add more watch faces in this band via simple mod, which I have explained on my youtube channel. This is very long review divided into 3 parts namely, Quick Overview, Full Detailed review and Comparison of it with MI Band 4. So if you are really looking to invest 2300-2600 rupees, then I highly advice to read it completely, to ease your decision. ●● If you want to get quick overview of the device, then read below else scroll down for Detailed Review ●● # The Screen is Full Touch Coloured AMOLED with 2.5D slightly curved at the edges. * Brightness is Adjustable. # Has above average Battery backup of 12 days on normal usage and upto 7 days on Heavy use. # Its very Light weight and compact. # The Strap is extremely comfortable and also replaceable. * Its Not easy to remove it, which is good as safety, but pain when you want to replace. # Has Full Whatsapp, Instagram, Message, Call, etc Notification alerts. # Updates are Frequent ( Got 2 updates right out of the box ) # Connects to both android and iOS, without any problem. # Has many pre built watch faces & more can be installed via Mod. # Watch interface is Clean and easy to use. Though bit laggy at times. # Has ACCURATE built-in Continuous Heart Rate monitoring, insanely Accurate Sleep Tracker and Pedometer. * SpO2 sensor is also added, but I am not aware of its accuracy. # Has Music control option as well. # It is swimming safe as well ( I tried it personally ) # Cost is very apt compared to features. Full Detailed Review :-- ● DESIGN : ----------- # It is Slim compared to MI Band 4 and 0.95"" 2.5D display surrounded by black bezels perfectly blends in. # It is extremely Light as well ( just 24 g with straps on ). # It has Circular Touch sensitive Home button, similar to MI Band & is very Handy. # It has 2 pin contact charging dock, so the Back of the watch is completely flat and Smooth adding to comfort. # Finally Quality of the strap is above average and feels comfortable. * They are clip on type and it takes bit of efforts to remove them. ● DISPLAY : ------------ # It sports 0.95"" AMOLED Colour display which gives crystal clear output. # The display is Rectangular with Vibrant colours and Bright Light (Adjustable) # Its very responsive and has good readability even in direct sunlight as well. # Interface at times are bit laggy. ● FEATURES : --------------- It has 8 Main modes namely Daily activity tracker, Heart Rate sensor, SpO2 sensor, Sleep tracker, Workout, Messages, More (settings) & Music control. # In Activity tracker, complete pedometer and calories details of the day are mentioned. * Its 95% accurate according to my usage. # In Heart rate sensor, you can quickly check the heart rate and it displays it in continuous manner for few seconds before it stops. * Its the best heart rate tracker I have used in any Fitness band and its almost 95% accurate. * You can even set heart rate tracking on Continuous mode from the app. # In SpO2 sensor, you get to check Live reading which are real time. * There's also a BPM readings shown below it. * I didn't had any medical apparatus to compare its accuracy, so can't comment on the accuracy. # In Sleep tracker, you can just view the sleep time of previous night. * To check the detailed data you need to use the app. * It also tracks the day-time sleep data. * Its the Most accurate sleep tracker I have used in any fitness band or smartwatch. * Trusleep mode is what makes it such accurate, but it consumes lot of battery and eats up DOUBLE the battery. # In Workout mode, there are many in-built modes like walking, running, swimming, free exercise, etc. * In this mode you can set alerts and targets separately for each session. * There's continuous heart rate tracking in any workout mode. # In Message option, you can check all your smartphone notifications when connected to it. * It supports phone message, whatsapp messages, etc. And you can read the complete message. * It also supports call notifications, which has call Rejection option as well. * You also get direct notification and sedentary alerts on band without needing to check the message option. # In MORE, there are various micro settings and more features like Timer, stop watch, Watch faces, Reset, Power off, etc. * There are couple of built in watch faces, with one of them being LIVE watch face. More can be added via Mod, which I have explained on my youtube channel. * Its very thoughtful to put extra settings or feature in the more option, so as to keep the interface clean. # In Music control, you can control the tracks playing on the smartphone when its connected to phone. * There's complete track control available. * 3rd Party app control is also available like youtube music, etc. * There's also Volume control option via band. ### Best part about the interface is, when the screen goes blank when you are in certain option/mode, it brings you to exact same position where you were when you immediately wake it up by tilting the wrist or pressing the home button. ● BATTERY PERFORMANCE : -------------------------------------- # It charges quite quickly from 0 to 100, within an hour. # With band not connected to bluetooth, not in Trusleep or continuous HR mode lasts upto 14 Days. # With Bluetooth connected and Continuous HR mode, it lasts upto 7-9 Days. # If Fitness app is used for about a hour or more with Trusleep ON, then it lasts upto 7 Days max. * I prefer to keep it bluetooth mode all the time and continuous HR mode, but Don't turn the Trusleep ON, by which I easily get upto 7-10 days of backup with 1 hour of workout mode used 6 days a week. ● CONS : ------- # Biggest issue is the Display. Since its Glass, its prone to damage easily, if screen protector is Not used. * Need to install screen protector for sure. # Some features like Remote camera shutter, Outdoor Cycling works only in Honor phones and iOS devices. # In Notification option, only the Latest message from a single sender is visible, while rest of the message from the same sender CAN NOT be viewed. Also there's noticeable Lag in notification option. # There serious Connectivity issue. Bluetooth only works when Huawei Health app is ON. # Can't view Detailed Sleep tracking on the band itself. You will need the companion app for that. # To Turn the band ON every time, you need to connect charging dock to it. ●● COMPARISON with MI BAND 4 ●● ------------------------------------------- 1. Design section - Honor band is more attractive than MI band due to its Curved display, when it comes to looks. Winner - Honor Band 5. 2. Display section - Display of Honor band is slightly more brighter than MI band 4. Touch response is Better on MI band 4. Honor band has Laggy interface. Winner - MI Band 4. 3. Pedometer & Workouts - Pedometer accuracy is almost same on both the bands. But there are twice as many workout modes on Honor band compared to MI band. Winner - Honor Band 5. 4. HR Sensor - Heart rate sensor is 3 times more faster and highly accurate in Honor band 5 compared to MI band 4. * There are blackouts in Continuous HR measurement in MI band at times. Winner - Honor Band 5. 5. Sleep Tracker - Sleep tracker of Honor band is undoubtedly much more accurate. Honor band also measures day time data, which isn't available on MI band 4 Winner - Honor Band 5. 7. Battery Backup - Battery backup is indeed better on MI band, almost double compared to honor band 5. Winner - MI Band 4 8. Accessories - Replacement straps are easy to access on MI band and finding spares is also easy compared to honor band. Winner - MI Band 4 9. Features - Features are even matched on both the bands. But MI Band has Music control option which is very handy. Winner - MI band 4. 10. Price - Finally MI band is 300 rupees cheaper than Honor band. Winner - MI band 4 11. Extra features - There's complete week's weather forecast available on MI band compared to only single day on honor band. Music control is present on both. Finally, there's SpO2 feature in honor, which is deal maker. Winner - Honor Band 5. ● VERDICT ● ------------- After a Month usage and trying almost all the fitness band under 3K price, I can firmly conclude that its the Best fitness band under this Segment. From the above comparison, its even more clear that Honor band get 6 points off 11, and is indeed better compared to MI band 4. So if you have budget upto 3000, then certainly go for this band and yes, buy a Screen protector immediately if you happen to buy this band. Hope this helps you make sound decision.",positive
this football is ideal for learners and as well for players as it gives good bounce to you but this football is made with some rubber so we should play with shoes or else this will hurt you this football can be played on grass as it moves and gives smooth first touches and if played on hard surfaces it will bounce alot and it maybe not good for the playersoverall this football is worthy to play,neutral
This is the first time I am buying and using a power bank! Also thiswill be my first MI product! The power bank is quite good. It takes around 5 hours to charge the power bank and it can charge my phone from 7% to 85% in just 3 hours .my phones battery is 5000 mah mind it! So definately it has fast charging option!

"writing this review after using this phone for a week. its the best phone in this price range, and the only phone with 6000 mah in this price bracket. I got 4gb/64gb variant for RS 11500 only in Amazon sale. Coming to its pros 1) 6000 mah battrey ( lasts for two days if you are not a gamer else depends on you usage) 2) primary camera is 48megapixels which actually takes amazing detailed images and front camera is good enough for blurred background shots. it also has inbuilt beautify feature, which you can adjust while taking selfies. 3) Triple camera setup is perfect, specially the wide angle camera is surprisingly good. and one feature which no other phone is providing in this range is, you can also take wide angle videos from the wide angle camera which is really cool. 4) Night mode is good and take vibrant and well lit photos at night. 5) With Super amoled FHD+ , trust me this screen is the best in this price range. 6) Exynos 9611 processor is pretty good enough for games like PUBg / Asphalt etc. you wont regret you decision. 7) Finger print reader is adequately fast. 8) I personally like the white color variant. And good m30s Is offering that. cons Nothing as such, as per this price range. i will update if anything comes up.",positive

It’s an awesome phone for the price. Very few phones come with SD660 at this price and has a similar camera clarity. The only disadvantages are the lower battery capacity and the lack of expandable memory card holder. Built and display are better than the competition and the Android One promise of two year guaranteed updates makes it a safe buy.,positive
"You can not play 1080P resolution videos.. and it is just an hd+ display,if you have been using full HD+ display it might make you fell odd while using. Make sure you visit mi stores and have a hands on experience and make a decision..",neutral
Overall everything is ok. It would have been good if the camera increases from 13mp to at least 25mp for rear camera. For latest Samsung M30 they improved everything for old users they didn't provide any benefits. It would have been better if they provide some more benefits on this.,positive

Bear in mind one can buy much cheaper lenses and still have the facility. I can't add to the wealth of information on the a6000 to be found on the net. Most reviewers are enthusiastic about almost everything except the tough-to-find-things menu structure. This 2-lens kit is an easy entry point. I'd recommend, however, considering more carefully what lens you would like to have on your camera almost all the time. If it isn't one of these two, then buy a bare body and save the money towards the lens of your choice. In retrospect, mine would have been the 18-105 with constant f/4. If you have a steady hand, using old/manual lenses is easy on this camera. My Olympus 50mm has come out of the cupboard after a long time. Manual focusing is easier than it was on the old film SLR, and focus peaking etc make it even easier. A set of extension tubes is also a worthwhile addition to this kit. It adds actual macro, missing with these lenses, at a fraction of the price of a macro lens.",positive
"1. The sound is too low that you will not hear the ring tone. The problem mostly occurs if you keep phone down (on table or some where similar). My mom has been using the phone for past couple of days and she has not been taking any phone calls since then. No one in the house is even hearing the sound to pick when ringing. 2. 5A was much better than 6A in terms of screen size. Even though the dimensions of 6A is bigger, 5A has much better usability. ( Eg : The back button which is placed in 5A vs 6A ) . 3. The photos / videos app is too noisy that it confuse what we should do with it. 4. Too much of tracking / spam apps to advertise. 5. The apps are getting hanging. You want to close the opened apps. The UI is a mess. 6. No infrared feature as in 5A. Oh god, your data is taken to China in the name of Make in India. I wonder why the government is allowing such things.",negative

"Was searching for a budget smartphone and thinking to go for some Chinese Brands like the one I had before but then I came to know about release of this phone. For the sake of getting a good phone from brand like Samsung at unbelievable price, I think the wait was worth it. Delivery was the best as I got the phone in my hand within 4 hours of placing the order during Prime Early Access. I am using the phone for since then and faced no issues till now. Let's see what it have on its plate for future. Writing this review as I got call from Samsung Executive asking for rating I would give to the phone. I said 5 as no issue till now and really enjoying the features. Then he insisted to share the same on Amazon and here I am ;) Attached are few pictures of device and few pictures clicked from device using different features of camera. I was sitting at the terrace of my house while writing this review and saw a plane going so tried to click the picture of plane with moon in the background. Same is attached for your reference. Thanks for reading my review.",positive
"So far satisfied with my purchase. Device feels solid and well built, Battery backup and Fast charge is beyond expectation. Screen is best in the segment. Phone is ultra fast & it never lags or hangs. Below are the pros & Cons according to my experience so far - Pros- -Really long long battery backup & Super effective fast charge. -Best in the class Display. -Solid Built Quality. -Bloat free & responsive loaded operating system. -Touchscreen & Fingerprint scanner are ultra fast responsive. -Dolby Atmos Audio (But u need a really good headphone to experience it) -Dual dedicated SIM tray with dedicated SD card slot. -Quality of Cell Phone signal is exceptional. -Lots of new amazing extra features like Gestures , Up side down call silent, Palm gesture for Screenshots and many more..... Cons- -No Slow-Mo Video. -No Night Mode. -No major software update & no more feature updates. Only security Patches. Overall a great experience, Thank you Amazon for a fast delivery. Im eagerly waiting for Updates for my phone & for the release of next generation of M30 as I'm planning to gift my wife & mom the same, on Diwali as they are amazed by the Looks & Features of my M30.",positive

"Overall the Samsung M30s is the best phone in this price segment and it shows the better performance. The fingerprint reader is very fast and I think it takes ½ of second!!! It is very fast than i thought. The fingerprint sensor can also control the notification bar up and down. It is very useful to me. The camera quality is very good in this price segment. I just loved it and it shows awesome performance in pictures and the quality. The video is also mind blowingand its super study mode is very awesome. Both front and back cameras are showing very good results. The battery life is very very awesome. It's above my expectations and really an amazing performance. You can't carry a powerbank with this phone. Just simply put in your pocket and walk away for a day and night. The M30s doing amazing battery optimization. I just got 10½ hr screen on time while playing pubg,playing movies and music,internet browsing etc. The battery life is awesome. Then the display... its just mind blowing and amazing. You can simply use it at sunlight. The overall quality and performance of the Samsung M30s is just mind blowing and its very powerful in this price segment😍😍😍",positive

The galaxy M30s is a phone with high end premium features at a mid range price. For the price it is selling it is a steal deal. The battery is amazing and will last you an entire day on a full charge. The camera quality is superb and the OS is very smooth and easy in operation. The only issue i feel is with the increase in the speaker volume. When you increase the volume to one below the maximum it's pleasant but the maximum volume just is too much to bear. It's not a deal breaker at all though.,positive

"For a DSLR, it is relatively compact, light in weight and easy to operate. Although certainly a step up from a smartphone, it’s just not all that exciting or satisfying to use for anyone with a deep interest in photography. Build quality is good enough to withstand normal usage, although not rough treatment and neither the camera nor the lens is weatherproof. The kit lens is an average performer across its focal length range. I'd recommend paying extra for stabilisation if you add a telephoto lens to the basic package. It lacks in some features, especially with the 30fps recording, 9-point focus system and the lack of a headphone jack, but if you are into photography, the camera makes up for it with the still great picture quality and amazing battery life for its price. I doubt it would provide the best stepping stone for beginners who want to improve their mastery of photography.",positive

The main draw back with put me down. Is lack of play store support. It is 2019 how can a smart TV run without android apps and no playstore support. Please at least inform in your product description that I won't come with play store other wise it is a tantrum between customer and company buy value.

"Performance: 8/10 Security: 10/10 Design: 9/10 Sound: 8/10 Camera: 8/10 Battery: 7/10 Compatibility: 2/10 Software: 8/10 (10.3 upgrade fixes a lot of bugs) Verdict: 7/10. (Q) Who should buy? - Those who are using iPhone since at least 2 years and have at the most iPhone 6 model. - Those who are frustrated from technical snags in Android or other firmware and want stability and performance as first and last resort. - Those who are Not inclined on value for money. Believe me, iPhone would always seem exorbitant on price. (Q) Who should Not buy? - Those who have iPhone SE or 6s. Both models are very close to performance of iPhone 7. You'd perceive the difference only with resource intensive gaming or apps usage on daily basis that is least likely. On comprehensive note, yes iPhone 7 has quad core processor but there's no radical difference compared to SE and 6s. - Android users who are cogitating first time experience for iPhone. Rather going for iPhone 7, step down to iPhone 6 at almost half the price. Use it for a year and then if you are determined, go for latest Sept. 2017 release. You will not regret decision at that point with still good resale of 6, and getting latest release for coming years. - Camera? No, it's definitely good but not worth of the whooping price tag. Compared to S7 and Pixel, the images are dull in color and sharpness. - If you can't handle it properly. Just a slight drop may cost you fortune and a never ending dinning table lecture. Repair charges are maddening for customer damaged phone. Though it's water and dust resistant (not proof) but still make sure you have best in class protective cover (Spigen) and tempered glass. (Q) Any software glitches? - Plethora of with 10.2 but an upgrade to 10.3 would solve most of the bugs and performance is back as supposed with Apple product. Highly recommended. (Q) Is iPhone 7 a bad choice? - There's no iPhone that you can call bad if you know what you want. There's not even a competition in countless facets such as smoothness, vivid display, security, and much more that takes user experience in premium tier. iPhone effortlessly stands out of the crowd. It won't compel you for a gmail account and then leak your information in incalculable direction while you are all oblivious. That's why the number is drastically less for iPhone users who switch back to any other firmware. - The support is like traveling in most expensive luxury air suit. The only trouble you got to take is visiting Apple center on the unfortunate event of issues with phone. Any manufacturing defect will mostly lead an instant replacement. Strictly, no procrastination of a resolution. (Q) Anything else for scientists? - There are two variants of iPhone 7 models, A1778 with Intel and A1660 with Qualcomm chipset in modem for signal reception. Lot of reviews advise Qualcomm is better with latest LTE bands compatibility and signal reception; but the model A1660 is available only in US. India has A1778 model and that is point of anxiety only if you plan to use the handset in US, and with Sprint or Verizon carriers. I did some checks near dead spots with iPhone 7, 6s and 5s (in India) and nowhere A1778 showed major difference than 5s and 6s. The calls and signal strength was almost identical, you could do same tests in elevators or in other dead spots. (Q) Battery, music? - Battery would last for a day comfortably on general usage. Gamers, depends on GPU engagement. Hotspot and 4G as well will drain faster but there's rarely going to be sight you making to home with phone shutdown for low battery. - Speakers are stereo, one is at bottom and other is within earpiece. The music quality however is inferior compared to iPhone 5s/ 6s.",positive

Like: Mobile has good screen size and good display quality.Look wise phone is very good. Fast charging as it's type C charger. Dislike: No headphone provided which is now in all phones It has triple rear camera but it takes time to capture snap. This phone has 6 GB RAM but perfomance wise not much difference with 4GB RAM other mobiles One major problem I see is mobile network signal strength is also weak it takes time when I call someone then after 30 second some dialer tone will come. Not sure this is because of Idea network issue in pune or because of mobile.,neutral
The phone is not like other Samsung .network is not full at anytime or anywhere. 6000mah battery is gives feedback like 4000mah.camera quality is not like 48 mp . Think before you buy because all the youtubers promote this phone like Salman's movie,neutral

"Writing this review after using mob almost 120 days. 1). Front Camera is good but doesn't meet the quality of 32pixel. Back is much much better than front. Rating 3/5 for front and 3.5/5 for back. 2). Battery backup is not good. This mobile is not for game lover. However I purchased it for study purpose hence it is quite compatible for me. Rating 2.5/5 3). Touch and screen:- Screen is full hd hence one will surely enjoy movies and PDF readings and touch is also excellent. Rating 5/5 4) Ram:- I have it's 3/32 version. I never played Pubg but I have played Asphalt 9, while Playing I faced lagging problem but only for 0.5 second's lagging hence will not be an issue with 4/64 version. Rating 4/5 5) Processor:- It equipped with an advance Processor. Rating 5/5. 6) Overall view:- This mobile is good if you are looking for study or some general purpose i.e. YouTube, Google, ms office and all. But not for high graphics game lover so I recommend you to buy it's 4/64 version and if ur are buying it for purpose of photography then I will say if you are good in photography than you will surely not going to satisfied with it at all. 7) Storage:- got only 22gb in 32gb storage Overall rating:- 3.5/5",neutral

"The phone has a massive 6.4 inch display with extremely small bezels and a dew drop camera. It is well built and the gradiation black colour is mesmerizing. The phone's 5000mAH has a great battery life that lasts well over a day. The fhd + sAMOLED display is really good. The rear and the front cameras do a good job in taking great photos . The ultra wide rear camera also does a great job in taking pictures of landscapes and nature. The exynos 7904 processor makes the device run smoothly with no lag. The device is also very responsive and has a good placement of the power and volume buttons. The drawbacks of this phone include a fingerprint reader that isn't really responsive , hopefully a software update can fix this . The device is also running only android oreo and hasn't received an update to pie. I rate this a phone a 7.5/10 as it is really worth the price",positive

Wide Angle Camera provides great photos. 3) Look and Feel is ultimate and gives eligent feel while handling the phone. 4) Performance wise looks good and no such lag observed while using it. Cons: 1) Initially found that phone is heating a bit but that was due to all syncing and updating the apps. Otherwise it is completely normal. Apart from that, I haven't found anything to worry about till now. Surely update this review once I will use it for longer time.",positive

I bought the phone out of expectation but it turned out to be better than expected. Like the feature specially the camera and screen size. Battery life retains till 24 hrs.

The features are good as any high end Samsung phone. Specs are good. I love the battery longevity and it lasts more than a day even upto two days.

It's going to stay with me for a long time!,positive

"Note:- Canon camera body does not have in body image stabilization, canon provides image stabilization through lens and camera body depends on lenses for image stabilization, if lens does not support image stabilization camera will not be able to stabilize. Pros 1080/60p video capture Microphone input jack for external microphone for better audio recording 24MP sensor with Dual Pixel AF 3"" fully-articulating touchscreen LCD 45-point all-cross-type phase-detect Fastest Auto Focus System 6fps continuous shooting Built-in interval timer for time lapses Digic 7 processor Dual control dials Accurate Auto Focus in both photo and video Responsive touchscreen and interface Top LCD for shooting information Twin control dials for more hand on control Very good video and image stabilization Wi-Fi,Bluetooth,NFC that can be used for image transfer and as remote control. Light weight. Cons Plastic build quality of body Lag behind in dynamic range No 4K video recording Pentamirror viewfinder instead of pentaprism viewfinder Suggestion:- Do check local store, price in local store tends to be less than price on amazon. Verdict:- Canon 77d sits in between 800d and 80d. It is decent upgrade from 800d and offers functionality of 80d at fraction of its price. The real shortcoming is that it does not support 4k video, other wise it would have been a perfect DSLR. Nonetheless if is good and a recommended camera. I hope my review has been helpful to you. If you have any question feel free to message me or comment down below. I shall be glad to assist you .",positive

"I believe firmly that this is the Best Affordable Phone Apple has ever made!!! 1. Superb Build 2. Amazing Screen, Excellent Sunlight visibility, Great contrast and watching content on this screen or Reading is just an absolute pleasure!!! 3. A12 Bionic chip is flawless!! day-to-day usage, Gaming, Multi tasking all works great. 4. Being a singer, as I record songs in Karoke apps like Smule and Starmaker, recording I made thru iPhone were the best so far in the huge list of phones I used, eversince I started singing. In-Box headphones are wonderful and the Mic just works amazing. (Interested to check my recordings, please check with the ID : vindurocks, same ID for both Smule and Starmaker). 5. The highlighting factor about this phone is the Battery Life. The A12 Bionic chip is such power efficient that it my phone still has atleast 40% battery left whern I reach home after work!! and thats incredible looking at the battery capacity that apple furnished in the phone. (I have my Data connection always ON, bluetooth ON and connected to Airpods, and when in Office, always connected to WI-Fi) 6. Camera is Good too on this.. though not the best camera apple made, but it gets the job done for me. So no complaints on that as well!! 7. Buttons are super tactile and clicky.. Ear piece is clear. Signal reception is Good as well. So its actually works well as a phone apart from all other shenanigans I mentioned earlier. So Full Marks Apple :) 8. The face unlock is blazing fast and its more secure than most of the android phones out there. So no complaints for not furnishing a fingerprint reader. (after the upgrade to iOS 13.2, face unlock became much more efficient. So great job done. On a whole, even if you are a power user, this phone will suffice with all the aspects you are expecting out of a smart phone. And my sincere advise to other who are out there is, if you already own this phonne, then don't go for iphone 11.. instead, use it for 2 years and go for iPhone 12, as we are expecting some breakthrough features with the same. So this is my opinion and Kudous to apple for making this attempt in making this iPhone a Great Value For Money device.",positive

Comes in with a built in 6"" micro USB cable though a usb-c cable would also be extremely useful (in addition). The battery pack is quite heavy and long (it's larger than my phone) so it isn't easy to carry around or keep in one's pockets. Best is to throw it in the bag and use a different longer cable to charge as you go. If available, go for the black color pack. The white tends to get dirty very easily and it all shows on the exterior.",positive

"First of all,thanks to Samsung to bring such a phone equipped with monster battery with a good price tag. Every phone has some pros and cons and so on same with the M30s. promising points:- # BATTERY is the catching point while buying this phone,everyone wants their phone last long with heavy usage as well #FHD plus display unquestionably best in the market # camera is descent Need improvements factor:- #personally I am not happy with the speaker output,while listening online songs...its more disappointing so sound is must improving factor #fingerprint reader also not accurate all the time,response time is not quick #camera could be more better,the portrait mode or live focus makes photo over saturate so there is missing of natural effect or true color effect. Verdict:- Overall it's good value for money phone and could be better with improved camera ,sound and fingerprint reader quality may be with near future software updates can resolve the issue if Samsung takes it seriously #",positive

Worth the money I spent and also additional features like fingerprint and face recognition to unlock amazing and would like to share few negative points like front camera clarity or quality of picture is not like earlier samsung phones. I think you people copied Oppo/ Vivo which is giving very poor quality images. Hope you will address this case and take necessary action in upcoming models. And I'm looking for fingerprint on screen rather than bottom of Mobile. And I have seen many of other manufacturers mobile has SMS organizer feature which Samsung doesn't have in any of the models. I have not got any earphones with mobile which is again bad thing. I may buy outside but I will not feel voice quality and I can not blame earphone or mobile. And now you are sending SMS to win an earphone which is other manufacturers product & giving it to your beloved customers only for 50 numbers.

I did a game spree for 4 hours. No heating issues no laggs and battery was still at more than 50% Cons: 1. I feel the phone is heavy. Could be due to battery but is heavy. 2. Fast charger is there but still needs around 1+hr to charge. 3. Samsung new UI and them ( i personally do not like the new UI. similar colour and icon makes it confusing) 4. No headphone in the box and no back cover.",positive

When switched to headset Mose it works fine but on changing to loudspeaker, each time there is a problem. Also, when on headset mode, the opposite person's voice can be heard by someone sitting away even with the lowest volume. No privacy of conversations!! Had oneplus3t earlier and thought of upgrading but very disappointed as the basic purpose of the phone is making calls and lots of inconvenience faced during the first day itself.",negative

"I liked the over all performance of the mobile. But the phone gets heated if more apps are used at once. Also to mention it gets charged pretty quick... But also gets heated at the time of charging. I didn't have to charge the phone much often. Because, it didn't require that much charging thanks to its monster capacity battery life. The phone is bit heavy compared to my previous phone and is wide. It plays 1080p60 videos on YouTube. Had a good time Watching movies, series, and playing Pubg. Also it didn't consume that much of battery while playing games (Pubg). I would suggest people to buy 128GB, because the picture quality is good, and also shoots good slowmotion videos for which memory would be needed. Also, finger print sensor and face detection works best in this phone. It's has sAMOLED display which gives HD display. Pros: Good battery life Camera quality (reare as well as front) Good gaming experience Fingerprint reader Face reader sAMOLED display SAR is less than 0.5W/Kg Good Mobile look It Has Dolby Atmos so good speaker quality It Has screen mirroring Cons: Gets heated while charging Gets heated when more apps are open Heavy in weight",neutral

Fingerprint reader is slow. You can't get better at this price. Camera quality can be taken to new heights by installing Gcam mod. Battery life is great. It has OLED display but 720p looks disappointing if you have used 1080p and above display. Value for money btw.,positive

"I found this ""Mi 10000mAh Power Bank"" good but not excellent as compared to other advance version of ""10000mAh Pro"". Advantages of Pro version compared to 2i version are: 1. Little Slimmer 2. Little Lighter in weight 3. Fast self re-charging and mobile charging Disadvantage of Pro vs 2i for some folks but not for all. 1. Single USB instead of 2 USBs. I have used both the versions, I prefer the Pro version. Another thing to bring you in notice that these ""Duracell 6700mAh Power bank"" is also available which I would prefer than the both because: 1. Single time or twice recharge mobile is more than sufficient for me because nowadays mobiles too have bigger batteries and take 6-7 hrs or more to completely drain. 2. Warranty issue: Mi provides 6 months warranty but Duracell provides 2 years warranty. 3. Duracell power bank air travel safe. 4. Duracell is much compact, slimmer and lighter than the Mi versions. 5. Single USB is also sufficient as needed to charge single mobile. One thing which goes against Duracell is it is costlier than the other two which is almost double the price. Thanks for reading.

"""My Wife Can't Listen to me, But Alexa Can"" The new echo dot 3rd gen is much better than previous model. I got it at 2700 after all discount and cash back which is again a steal a deal. Now after using it for 2 months, here is my genuine review which help others future buyers to decide to buy or not to buy this product. -What I like About This Product. 1. Built Quality is perfect and strong. 2. Sound Quality with balanced bass. 3. Super Voice Detection thanks to 4 Inbuilt mic. 4. Fast Bluetooth connectivity and sync. Process. 5. Calling through Alexa is super fun and easy. 6. Cristal clear voice quality. 7. 3.5mm Audio Jack is again + for this product. 8. Best ecosystem for smart home control. 9. Perfectly work with all Alexa enabled device. 10. Multiple Alarm, Reminder, To-Do List works perfect. 11. Alexa calling is super fun and I really enjoyed this features subject to the other person having account in Alexa. 12. Can create shopping list for you. But can not tell deals and promotions, so be careful and check the offers before placing the order. What I don't like. 1. Not answer all the questions correctly. 2. Only support English language. 3. Get stuck after turning it on after a long break and I have re-start the device to make connection again which irritate a lot. 4. Answer is not as clear at Google Home mini. 5. Listen only clear english, so if you are Not Good in English then Alexa will irritate you a lot. Addition details: I would recommend this device to those who use Alexa enabled device in their home or office..but if you are using Google enabled device then I would not recommend this device.",neutral

"THE BEAST. after a month of research i finally decided to write a review on the IPHONE 7 PLUS. first of all let me tell u a point clearly. if budget and size is not gonna be a problem for you.I will suggest the iphone 7 plus to iphone 7. its not that iphone 7 is not good but comparing to iphone 7 plus the iphone7 is a bit lower. Some of the features that you will miss in iphone 7 that you got in iphone 7 plus is listed below 1.DUAL CAMERA 2.1920X1080P (IN IPHONE 7 IT IS 1334X750P,u can get more resolution in 7 plus) 3.LARGER BATTERY LIFE(2910 MAH IN 7 PLUS,1960 MAH IN 7) 4.3 GB RAM IN 7 PLUS(2GB RAM IN 7,which makes us understand improved perfomance in 7 plus) These are some missing features in iphone 7 plus.Happy that the iphone 7 plus now comes with OIS(optical image stabilization) which means when you record a video. you can notice the shake is reduced.u can see the video is stabilized a bit.apple has introduced 2 new colours that is BLACK and JET BLACK. if you are going with the JET BLACK please make sure u get a skin or case which is available on amazon.The new apple iphone 7 and 7 plus is water and dust resistant. WATER RESISTANT UPTO 1 METER AND 30 MINUTES. HOPE YOU LIKED THE REVIEW.THANK YOU",positive

I have switched from iPhone 8plus to iPhone 11 and I must say I am really impressed and speechless I can't ask more than this. 1 - Best Lcd you won't disappoint I am myself product designer and pixel pepper display plays a very important role but am really impressed with this display. 2 - Size of the phone is perfect not to big not to small and I am guessing loads people may be concerned about that big bezel or notch compare to iPhone 11 pro or 11 pro max after using for a while you don't even realize about that. 3 - Everythings looks so good in this phone using the app in this phone is a completely different experience if you come up from old iPhone with big bezels 4- Face ID is just one of the best features. Loads people still cry about touch id not there but they are so wrong. Face ID is so fast and so cool I am just loving it. 5- Camera Kills all the flagship android phone. What amazing photos you can click with this phone night mode is the rockstar. So Bottomline whoever is thinking to buy this phone just go for it you won't regret,positive

"Writing his review after 2 months of usage. I had great expectations when I bought this brand, but I now ended up repenting my buy. My refrigerator has stopped cooling, even after a service guy tried to repair it, it still doesn't work, per service centre representative there was a leakage with the gas, and they had to replace it with some older model replacement, and now they have placed an order for my model. This shouldn't have had happened with reputed brands as such. However, disappointed with the buy. Adding after 6 months of usage now! My refrigerator broke down thrice in 6 months now, never repented this much....one may want to reconsider before buying this model.",negative

"I bought iPhone 6 on 13/10/18, since last month i. e. from March 2019 I'm facing a lot of problem with this device. Touch screen doesn't work at times, if it is just kept on any surface without locking the key pad, it will just function by its own. Any app will open by itself, it dials any random contact number. While I'm typing a message it picks up any alphabet & types either single letter or multiple. Every time I have to shut the screen & open. It's become frustrating now. I tried calling Amazon but they have very limited automated customer service, there is no way where I can speak to a human to explain my problem & get a solution. Hope I get some solution here.",neutral

"Got the pearl white 128 GB edition. The phone doesnt weigh much in hand and is comfortable to hold. The screen, when set on 'vivid' preset, is much better than that of my Oneplus6' screen. Cameras are of just about average quality. Interesting thing is when I opened the package, the phone gave a welcome message! Implies Samsung was so confident about their battery that they packed the phone without turning it off! Havent yet had time to check battery life, but the screen is a killer. I played some 4K 60fps hdr videos in youtube app on both m30s and oneplus6 side by side. M30S asskicked oneplus6, especially when the camera was paning in the videos. The 60fps smooth effect was visible in M30s, but not in Oneplus6. This is a great phone for people who mostly watch videos and use the phone for web browsing and social media. Its not for gamers and photography enthusiasts",positive

One major and two minor problems(in order) in my opinion: 1) the touch screen is not good specially while picking up the phone. This is the one of the primary function of the phone and sometimes it takes 3 or 4 attempts to pick up the phone. 2) the camera and video somehow makes you whiter than you are actually(perhaps they know how color obsessed we are) 3) unnecessary samsung apps.,neutral

In normal lighting the rear camera does have a hard time focusing and defining the edges in the bokeh mode. Pictures lack a bit in sharpness but keep its natural colours. Images in low light do end up having some noise even in night mode. Coming to the video.. The videos will end up with noise in low light but the super steady mode is pretty good On continous 4g mobile data usage with adaptive brightness the battery will last you for abt 1.5 days ( exluding 6-7 hrs of sleep).,neutral

The phone did heat up a bit but it's common now a days. 3. Comparing the price to product, it is an amazing buy. 4. Many claimed that the charging port does not work properly over long run. Its only 20 days, haven't faced that issue yet. 5. Battery life is huge, I have charged it 100%, with minimum usage it lasted more than two days. Heavy usage it lasted nearly a day. Cons. 1. The touch sometimes does not read properly. It becomes annoying sometimes. 2. Low light camera is a big con. Images loose their sharpness and video quality in low light flickers. I wish it had on-screen finger-scanner, because lot of mobile companies are offering this feature in this price range. LED notification a useful feature missing.",neutral

"Sound Quality, Noise Cancellation and Bluetooth Connectivity is good enough in this budget. But the mic went bad within 5months of purchase. Even one side earphone stopped working. But the main problem is that their customer service is hardly ever reachable if you face an issue. They pick up the earphones for service by a courier and never responded again. It's been 2 weeks already since I sent them my bluetooth earphones but I am yet to get a reply, leave alone getting my earphones. As far as I know this is a similar case like another brand called 'House of Marley'. 'Boat' Brand is very bad in their customer service response. This is a major drawback for an upcoming brand since if customer service team is careless then buying a 'Boat' brand product is as risky as buying any other non branded product.",negative

Pros- 1) Mi A3 is a good choice for a camera loving persons. Selfie camera is best in this class. 2) phone size is perfect (6.0 inch). This size is Not available in any other standard brand with good specifications. 3) premium feels in hand. 4) battery is well optimize. Its 4000 mah battery is almost equivalent to 6000 mah of my samsung galaxy m30s. Charger provided in box is 10 watt charger. charge the phone from 0 to 100% in 2hrs. In half hour charging it will give you approx 30% charging. Charger pin is tightly attached with phone when charging. 5) notification light 6) volume is loud both in earpiece and speaker 7) touch sensitivity is good. Cons- 1) google android one is worst. If you have used samsung one ui or miui 10 then this will break your heart. Almost all problem you faced in this phone is relate to google android one. Plenty of options are missing and availables having no proper optimization even you cannot veiw any you tube video in a proper manner and if you want to view any video from google this will stop many time and you have to touch in every 10 seconds to start again. This is not a single problem you can face many problems from all available functions and all will be related with android one. 2) finger print is slow. ** if you adjust with android one then strongly recommended otherwise this will create a trouble.**,neutral

"I purchased this from Mi app as soon as it was launched. I was using the first generation of Mi power bank prior to this, which still works today but isn't that good now. The below review is after using the powerbank for a month. I would be updating this review with more usage. #####Mi Power bank 2i Specifications### ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ > ABS plastic body > Capacity: 20000 mAH > Battery type: Li-Po > Quick Charge 3.0 support > Intelligently adjusts power output > low power charging > Two output ports, 5.1V, 2.4A MAX > Input, 5V, 2.0A > Two-way fast charge > 9 layers of circuit chip protection > Weight: 359g, yeah its bulky! > Dimensions: 69.6W X 149.5H X 23.9D mm, yeah its huge ###Design & Build### ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The 20000 mah Mi Power banks 2i have ABS plastic body that gives them a solid build quality and premium look that you don’t expect in power banks in this price range. Honestly, I prefer plastic over the metal casing, the reason being that a plastic casing doesn’t scratch easily and is not as slippery as metal. It has a textured pattern on front and the backside, that aims to improve grip. It also helps to improve the look. The plastic casing of this power bank makes for a far better finish, it doesn’t make the surface very slippery as the aluminium design. The casing is also scratch-resistant. The 20000mah Mi power bank 2i available only on white colour option. I think Xiaomi need to give other colour options because white colour can be easily dirty. It has curved corners and has Mi branding on the front. It has a two 2.4A(5.1V, 9V/12V15W MAX) USB output ports (fast charging) and micro USB input (5V,2.4A) port on the top side. There is a four-LED indicator light at the top of that shows the charge remaining, with each LED corresponding to a 25% charge. The power bank automatically switches on and off as soon as you connect a device, but there’s a dedicated power button on the right as well. The Power bank is not too much bulky compared to the huge 20000mAh capacity. With an overall weight of 359g, the power bank is lighter than other 20000 mAH power bank, which is impressive. The best part, there is no heating issue while charging or discharging. The dimension of Mi power bank 2i is just 2.8 inches wide, 5.8 inches long, and 0.94 inches depth. ###Capacity & Charging### ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The new 20000mAh Mi Power Bank 2i has features six high-density batteries from Panasonic and LG. The USB power control and charging chips of this power bank are made by Texas Instruments, which are far more reliable than what’s commonly used in other power banks in this price range. It can deliver 13000 mAH capacity out of 20000 mAH, as 85% charging conversion rate claim by Xiaomi. Power lost during voltage conversion is a common problem in power banks, so don’t expect full capacity in any power bank. The 20000 mAH Mi power bank 2i charge your 3000 mAH battery powered phone for 3.2 times. It means you can charge your iPhone 7 for 7 times and Mi A1 for 4.1 times. times. During the test, this power bank charges my Oneplus 3t(3400 mAH) for 3.8 times. The best thing about Mi power bank 2i is that it supports ‘Quick Charge 3.0’ technology. It only works when you are charging using a single port. And of course, It supports fast charging in both ways. The 20000 mAH Mi power bank 2i has a two 2.4A (5.1V, 9V/12V) output USB ports so it can quickly charge your phone compared to others. It charges 3000 mAH battery powered phone within 1:30 hours. If your phone supports fast charging. This power bank support 2.0A (5.0V) input. If you use a fast charger(2.0A or 2.1A), it takes around 9 hours in full charging. With 18W/2.4A charger, it takes only 4 to 5 hours in full charge. Basically, actual charging time depends on your wall adapter. ###Safety Features### ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The 20000 mAH Mi Power bank 2 comes with lots of safety features. >> Protection from Output Overcurrent >> Reset Mechanism >> Temperature Resistance >> Output Overvoltage Protection >> Protection from Short Circuit >> Input Overvoltage Protection >> Protection from Overcharge and Over-discharge >> Protection from Incorrect Insertion >> PTC Protective Circuits for the Cell",positive

"Hai, this my first 60days gentle REVIEW. From tamilnadu, tirupur. Packing: Nice packing Build quality: Outer plastic body hard and stronger. Screen is not like old CRT tv, this fiber easy breakable.so be carefull if your child play front of your tv . Mounting : Fixed wall mount only given. Stand mount not safe for 43"" model If you want adjustable to buy installation time service person cost around Rs.1600 Installations: Amazon not initialize installations request in sanyo customer care, After received product i have registered with sanyo customer care installations request. After 3 days comes service person for installations. Service persons is not SANYO android model sound knowledge person . Customer support: Initially i have facing 2 problem s, HDMI ARC connectivity, mobile screen cast connectivity, I am complaints raised sanyo customer service .that complaint transfer to near by Panasonic service center. After i am search with google resolve own . Panasonic service persons told screen mirroring not supported your mobile that's like told, and HDMi arc port is not Available in my 43inch android tv model that's like answer. Panasonic customer care is not trained service persons for higher end model tv service. Picture quality: Viewing angles ok. Initially my eye irritating. After 15days is ok. This is HDR10? DTH hd channel only picture quality Nice. Ordinary SD channel pictures quality poor, Audio quality: Nice for sound bar. With out sound bar poor. Accessories: Tv voice control remote mouse cursor option not working properly certain apps, Smart features: You tube working, Chrome browser is not in build , Play store app gives basic app only. External app installations difficult. Cost wise is high 35K Smart features is very basic level. Conclusion: I am disappointed.",neutral
"I will review this phone on the basis of practical usuage. 1) Battery : On normal usuage which means watching content online aprrox 3 hours,usual surfing for 4-5 hours, listening songs about an hour, the phone holds to about 25-30 hours after fully charges. It takes about 135 mins to fully charge from about 15-20% battery 2) camera : Front camera is ordinary, i was using oppo and it came better pics Rear camera is good , but takes time to click pics and adjust effect . 3) Multiapplication usuage: It smoothly runs multiple app very happy with that. 4) screen: Its the best part , optimum use of space of mobile and very clear , its like holding a mini tv on palm.",neutral
"Superb product. Totally happy with it. Bought it on Great Indian Sale and got cashback as well as instant discount. Its main attraction is its monsterous battery. It will last for 1 and a half day for mediam usages but for heavu usage it should last a day (12 to 14 hours). Camera quality is preety good. And the display is also very bright as well as colourful. Totally satisfied with it. But it has some drawbacks as well, its fingerprint sensor is fast but not as fast as other phones in recent times. I should say its 3 out of 5. Another thing is its front camera. It is little bit soft as compare to its megapixels. It also struggle in low light conditions. Another important security drawback is that it didn't provide any private mode or private space for personal pictures and files. Although Samsung provides it on its other divices like A series phones but not in vase of budget phones. Its an issue who have used it earlier. But samsung can easily fix it with an ota update. Overall its a worth buying phone. You can go with it without any hesitations. I think 4+64 GB is worth buying option than 6+128. Both of them are same except the storage. I think the higher varient is rs. 1000 overpriced as compare to 4,64 gb varient.",positive

"Product is advertised to be a monster. Was happy to gift to my brother, who was looking forward to use it. However, the fun ended when an obstructive band was discovered in the SIM card tray, which bent the tray, and made the removing and inserting the tray difficult. This is a physical/ structural defect. Amazon doesn't have any pro active helpline. Tried number of times to register my product return, in vain. Also tried repeatedly in vain to call them or get them call me. So my brother us stuck with a defective phone, and we're unable to get any help. The two starts awarded are for the Samsung brand, as it has been quite good so far.",negative

Good phone in low budget. Fast and responsive however gamers will rate it low. Battery life a little low but if your usage is just apps mails and calls will last for 8 to 10 hours. Fast charging is really great when you are really in hurry. 30 mins charge will give you enough battery backup. Both cameras are good with decent photo quality. Overall it's a good phone.,positive

Since I got my realme u1 I began a lover of realme brand I have never seen before mobiles at this cost and it's truly amazing it's 25 MP front camera captures pics like DSLR no other mobiles are comparable with realme in my opinion some of the youtubers say that everything is good in realme u1 but color OS is not so good but I think no other os is as cool as color OS even the Asus brand has the stock Android in its mobile but I had seen that it has no style. And it has a option in settings that's called smart and convenient it's an amazing feature by realme you can pick calls without touching your display you you only have to hold your phone near ear and call will be e connected automatically. I think most of the peoples are redmi fan but I would say that try realme phone once and you will fall in love with realme it's my challenge.,positive

"Merits - Premium and Beautiful looks. If you hold this phone in hand, people will notice and enquire about it. Processor - Very fast and responsive. Camera- Sharp, vivid, crisp pictures even in low light. Size - Apt size, easy to hold unlike other 6""-6.2"" phone. Ideally phone should not be so big and so small. This is the perfect sized phone. Display - So bright and real led quality phone. now if I look my previous phone I find the difference same between conventional TV and led TV. Battery - Honor declares 3000 MAH battery capacity but it is equals to 4000-4500 MAH of other brands. Battery last long. Truly the best looking and smart featured phone. I am very happy to buy it. It will fashionable even after 2 years. It is very good looking phone. Market value - With all such features price of this phone 128 GB is so competitive. I am sure no brand will offer such features like this phone. Demerits - Missing Fast charging - you can't charge this phone so quickly. Speaker phone - I had lenovo K5 note, it had Dolby atoms feature. But the speaker phone of Honor is not so impressive.",positive

"Definitely worth using, considering great offers on this. Xiaomi's power bank is definitely worth the amount spent on it. Charges phones sufficiently. The low-power dissipation mode is useful for charging smaller devices like Blue tooth headsets, though I haven't checked the charging performance for those. Has a great feel and is pretty compact while being held. Fits snugly in a pocket, and is quite thin compared to the earlier 10000 MAh bank from Xiaomi (silver box-like). No drop tests performed, but should be able to sustain damage from regular usage.",positive

After having experience on Apple, and Samsung devices the difference is quite evident and dissatisfying b) SDCard related issues are more relatively. Randomly shows corrupted SD Card whereas put those in Samsung or LG devices, they work just fine and can be easily explored c) Display (resolution) needs serious upgradation d) Software enhancements: UI Launcher, Mobile assistant software is quite limited and evidently slow, and quick charging",neutral

"Bought this TV during the festive offer. TV was delivered within 2 days. Kevin customer care was closed due to Diwali holidays. Installation person came after 4 days. He was a newbie and did not know most of the things. He kept calling someone one phone for guidance. After 3-4 hours of struggling he declared the TV was unable to connect to Wifi as there is a Software or Motherboard problem. I had to struggle with Amazon for a week with over 20+ calls to get it refunded. 2/5 points for Amazon in handling this case so badly. The technician Amazon appointed to verify the TV condition from Qdigi - who did not turn up and wasted our time - gets 0/5 Worst service from Qdigi. The 2nd technician appointed from Amazon - Vcare - gets 5/5 for a prompt service who confirmed that the TV is faulty. Coming to the review of the TV during my 10 days use - The picture quality is just ok ok.. Having used Sony 49 inch 4k TV and a VU Full hd 32 inch tv, I felt the VU quality better than the KEvin quality. Sony picture quality is way better than both. The sound quality on the Kevin was really bad.. The speakers on the VU 32 inch is much better. The onscreen menu and interface is also badly designed by Kevin. All the hdmi ports and usb ports are at the bottom, behind the Tv, which makes it difficult to reach. The remote is also confusing to use. Overall I could compare to the VU and Sony that we had, and the KEvin was nowhere a good TV. I'm glad we received a faulty TV and could return it. Waste of our time and effort.",negative

"It has been a month since I got these earphones and these are my first own Bluetooth earphones. However, I have tried many other earphones and headphones from different brands from my friends like boat, Samsung, sony, Skullcandy, jaybird, house of marley. I finally settled for this one because it's giving more than it's worth when compared to others. These are cheap in cost and rich in sound. Casual music listeners will enjoy this earphones thoroughly. I will list some pros and cons that a casual music lover looks for... Pros : 1)Deep boosted bass and balanced music at higher volumes...worth for money 2)Good fit, Light weight and flexible neck band with sweat and water resistant... perfect for workout 3)Around 6 hours of play time at 80% of full volume and around 1.5 hour for full charge 4) multi function buttons and different bud sizes Cons.... 1) little noise at the beginning that fades out as soon as the music starts 2) disconnection ( lag in music ) due to displacement of device for the first time only. It gets settled after the first time you move it and stays connected with out any further disruption.",positive

"Samsung Galaxy M30s - 12 days observation I ordered 4GB 64GB internal variant of Opal Black in Amazon.. Till now it’s cool. Wanted to share my 12 days observations Pros 1. Battery – I’m a normal mobile user. For me it lasts for 2 days. So 6000mAh is really working 2. Display – Happy with Super AMOLED display 3. Performance – Per my need I had not seen any delay/lag in performance. Even if the apps remain in RAM for couple of days, there is no lag 4. Signal Receiver – No issue. I checked Jio+ Idea 5. Mic – No issue. 6. Speaker – Sound is bit low. Can be improved. But it’s not that bad 7. Camera – I like the wide angle feature Cons 1. Camera – Basically I purchased this for camera. This should be improved. Sometimes I really doubt is it 48MP. The ""Live Focus"" mode sometimes doesn’t work as expected. 2. Finger print sensor – Sometimes this doesn’t detect soon. You either need to wash your hands(or) enter pin to access. The sensing is good. 3. Mobile heating – Mobile heats a bit when taking different photos with variations 4. Battery draining – No draining in case of normal conditions. I noticed some drain on excessive camera usage 5. Build quality – Back panel is plastic and it’s not that strong. The built quality should be improved. Better to use case All in all, as a mid range mobile, I think we can go for it.",positive

It takes a solid half to one second to enable the display once you turn your wrist. Earlier, I thought it was not working, but then learned to wait for a second to see the time. 4. Connected GPS doesn't work that great at times. There were times when I would finish running and still the GPS is not connected till the end. Pros: 1.

"I chose the echo dot over the Google home mini as the voice responses from Alexa is much more human sounding than from Google Assistant even though Google offers a lot more functionality and better voice recognition.

However, you should not purchase this if your primary use case is listening to music. *The device is built solidly and has some heft to it. The rubber base ensures that the speaker does not vibrate much. *The ability to create routines is a great convenience. *The wake word detection works well even from a distance of 5 meters. It sometimes fails to register the wake word in the middle of music playback. *The ability to stream music to an external wireless speaker is convenient although the bluetooth range is about 4 meters in direct line of sight. *The voice recognition can be improved a lot more. *Music streaming from sources like Hungama and Gaana are quite buggy and does not often have the music that you're looking for. *Voice recognition often cuts off in the middle of commands. *Alexa finds it necessary to list the names of all the artists in an album before the song, which can be very annoying as some tracks have upwards of 3 artists. *The response from Alexa when the wifi is down is quite long and irritating even if brief mode is enabled. There should be an option to limit it to just a single tone feedback. Unless you plan to have home automation, this device will get quite boring within a span of few days. You can have a much better sounding bluetooth speaker with the added factor of portability for less than half the price (comparing with my boAt stone 650).",neutral

"It's been 2 weeks now that im using the new Samsung Galaxy M30s. Here are the Pros & Cons: Pros 1. Camera's awesome. Hell lot of options to choose from for ur photos. 2. Rich feel of the handset overall with an amazing screen ratio. 3. As always, Samsung's UI is worth a praise. Extremely friendly to use with good navigation to choose multiple options in regards to basic user settings. Cons 1. Handset seems heavy to use at the start but one gets used to it over a period of time. 2. Samsung praises this model for its 6000mAH battery however even with basic usage (zero gaming), the battery lasts only for a day n a half. 3. A bit overpriced if one were to buy this model out of Amazon Festival.",neutral

Phone is great....no doubt ....value for money...the battery lasts for less than 24 hours for medium usage ...camera is ok ok...processor exynos is excellent ....can handle games like pubg without any lag. The screen is just excellent....its really awesome. Sound is also good but more on a treble side than bass....but in earphone Dolby atmos works great....and sounds excellent. The best part about samsung is its customer service either via phone/chat or service center....you won't find any difficulties on this. The software optimisation is the best in this phone...and you will feel like you are using a premium phone. Cons : 1)minor software lag at the notch area...will be fixed in next update. 2) No Bixby 3) no secure folder 4) no knox protection 5) no samsung pay mini 6) slow security patch n software update This are some basic features which samsung must have given and many can be given via software update.

I have bought this recently.. I feel it's so slim and nice to carry. But few of the things I just wanted to mention.. 1. Radio jack port is not available .. every time you need to carry external small cable given as USB supported to put radio jack. So need to carry all the times. 2. Sound quality.. when I put max then only it is audible clearly. Average if I put.. it's hearing very low. Hence always max required. 3. Back camera is not good. Of course given in device spec. 4. Battery backup is good. 5. Location service will be automatically make on when you open any location services app. So no short cut provided in status bar menu.,positive

The battery life is around 24 hours on heavy usage.. The camera produces excellent results..Depth and Bokeh effect are as they should be and not overdone. Night mode is pretty good. And Video recording was great..with stability . The super AMOLED display is extremely vibrant and produces a kind of depth effect which I didn't find in other phones..the display is one of this phone's best features.. On the negative side..I found that the phone lags a little.. The charging time is 2 and a half hours. There is no notification light..but for me personally I would prefer a phone without a notification light Overall..i found that the phone was pretty good.,positive
very cheap quality,negative
"Writing this review after a week of continuous use. Superb, fast & responsive phone with user friendly features. Not a game addict hance cant comment on that but gives a professional look &good for business use. Camers quality is good as well.

"I have been using Samsung M30 for more than one month, its been so far good experience. Firstly you get amoled screen in this price which is a bonus. Once I forgot charger in office but still I was able to stay till next day as it got massive 5000mah battery with a quick charging, USB C is bonus too. Nowadays everyone gives loads of RAM, but I trust 4GB ram from Samsung, its not always about 4gb or 6gb size, its the quality and performance from chipset matters. I also like the One UI core is very clean and easy. The best thing is it got Dolby sound, have a great earphones and the output is so good. I got update of Andriod 9 and its so good to get that early. I am a happy Samsung M30 user",positive

"I'm going to review it after 20 days,so I capture everything in this review, hope it will help you to find best one 6000mah battery really a giant because before this phone I was user of IPHONE5S so I used to carry a power bank with me anywhere but when I got this phone,Trust me not even a single day I used my power bank but camera is an average. Samsung state that they are giving 48MP rear camera but genuinely you can get far better picture in 8MP camera of an iPhone.Rear camera is good Speed of this phone is also impressive because 6GB ram is enough to go for the super speed and this phone is perfect. Shape of the phone is same as previous M30 and many s series.Little more heavier than mi phone and iPhones. I don't like the design of Samsung bcz thick sides are not look good. Touch and sounds are amazing,you can feel the smoothness In this price it's a best option but you have to compromise with camera. I attached some clicks, so please see for more clarity about camera.I used pro mode,Wide angle and normal angle.",positive

"Samsung Galaxy M30s is literally amazing. People used to tell me that Samsung Amoled Panels are best to view and it is exactly the same. The display is very beautiful to look onto and as it is amoled, it adds more to the battery also. Actually, I should mention about this monster battery first. For very heavy users, it will definitely gives you total 24 hours of charge from my experience. Very heavy means literally very heavy. Rest of the cases, its more than 1.5 days I'm very happy with it. The best thing is, cameras. They are very good at this piece point and details are amazing. And finally, major point of the review: One UI!! I am getting flagship experience in just budget price! Its literally amazing to use One UI and the features it gave is very good. The supersteady is amazing. Nightmode and all those camera effects work really good. When it comes to performance, since I am not a gamer, I can't give exact details but judging through my daily usage and from some of the famous youtuber reviews, it should work fine and after all its Exynos 9611. It is working really smooth. But, I have experienced one or two call reception problems but I think there may be very low signal ony end too. I will update if issue is more after my thorough usage. Lastly, Its Samsung R&D which puts alot of effort to balance the phone's weight and slimness. When I carry the phone, I didn't feel anytime that I am holding a 6000mAh battery phone! Its so slim that from sides it looks very very premium. I think I have covered all the points and with One UI and all those benefits and with that competitive pricing, M30s can be definitely your pick! Mark it helpful of it helps. That's all for now.",positive

i had been using a national now panasonic solo microwave since 1995 so you can imagine how tough it was to chose a replacement it was tough competition and samsung came out with flying colours it was the switches instead of touch and the ceremic coating which won the battle with other brands these were the two features because of which i didnt chose panasonic again the epoxy coating which other brands do is not tough enough panasonic still comes with rotary knobs in its solo option,negative

"Terrible sound quality. I don't have much idea about songs from the EDM, pop genre but if you are one who's into rock/metal or the likes then stay as far away from this as possible. The sound clarity is terribly. Lows can be lived with, the mids would make you hate your decision to buy, the highs would make you kill yourself. Noise cancellation is satisfactory but nothing beyond that. Charging never seemed a hassle to me and lasts a decent amount of time on battery. Build quality is good however it's only been a week. In terms of comfort, never really had any issues despite running it for a continuous 2-3 hours once. Buds are soft and fit in snugly. Bluetooth connectivity is strong, however there are times when the connection stutters. And yes, it cannot be refunded,only replaced. So purchase wisely.",negative

"Booked this 55 inch TV when Mi TV 4 Pro is available at 45K during Big Billion Day sales. I believed in the Brand and the Service(Sanyo and Panasonic;Never disappointed with Service and installation. They installed the TV within 2 hours after my call to Sanyo customer care; Coming to the Details of TV after 2 days of use 1. The picture quality is top notch. IPS LED SuperBright Panel is Very Good. All You tube videos are excellent on this TV. DTH HD channels are really Good but SD Channels are not that good. i do not know about HDR and what it does so far,may be i have to do a bit more research on this. 2. Android TV functionality is very good, it has basic apps installed and i installed Hotstar and Netflix. Amazon Prime is Not available. Youtube videos plays very smooth and Superb. 3.I connected my 2TB Ext Hard disk and it played all format videos without any lag. Thanks to it's 2.5G RAM. 4. videos from USB also played very smooth. 5.It has a ARC (sound out) on HDMI-2 ; 6. Connected my Firestick to this TV and watching movies in this is really Good. 7. With the SBI offers and Amazon pay balance i got this TV for 46K which i feel is worth the money. will update more details after full testing. The Air mouse feature works perfectly fine. Google assistant works very well. I had some trouble in installing some apps like Sun Nxt. But after restartin the TV, they seem to work OK.",positive

"The TV it is absolute value for money. Watching 4k pictures on Youtube, the quality is mindblowing. Though there isn't much Free 4K content available that is worth watching, but this TV is ready when needed. It nicely upscales 1080p and 720p content, has a nice frame rate, and the speakers are decent. the pictures are bright and crisp. Viewing angles are great. It does an admirable job for SD channels as well. Has a phone app in case you're one of them who habitually misplaces the remote. The app does exactly the same things as the remote does and takes voice commands as well. The appstore is very minimalistic, has Prime videos, Netflix and Youtube, but popular apps like Hotstar, SonyLiv, Zee5, Voot, and many more are missing. You need to buy Fire stick or chromecast for additional apps. In summary, for the price, as a 4K UHD TV this Panasonic 55"" is bang for the buck, but not the best smart TV features.",positive

Cons: 1. Finger print reader - too slow compare to competitors. 2. 720p display - when you are reading or watching a video in high-resolution you will notice the lack of sharpness 3.Brightness - screen is not bright enough on outdoors and minimum brightness it won't go below 14. It's hard to see screen in outdoor and in the complete dark situation. 4. Color Accuracy - it is not good most of the colours contrast is too high and sharper Pro 1. Camera - Especially Gcam night sight is fabulous. 2. Battery - Compromise on the screen resolution and mid processor makes battery last longer. Below average compare to the other competitors like realme.,neutral

"Built quality is good, feels sturdy in hand, feels premium, Matt finish gives it a solid look. I will rate the audio 7/10 as the lows are not that crisp and bass is not that high considering the price. It's a good speaker though only the volume could have been a bit loud. Bluetooth connectivity is good, connects very easily with no hassle. Only thing is you cannot take your phone to another room with a full wall partition only then the sound that's breaking. Won't comment on the battery life as I have received the speaker today by Amazon prime delivery and have not tested till the battery exausts. But it charge really fast. Have not tested under water or with in contact with water yet. It's a value for money product, but if you are looking for a high volume speaker you should go for JBL Charge series. This is ideal for a room size of 12X15 feet with 7-10 person. You will feel the volume bit low if played outside in open ground as the sound is focused only in one direction and not 360° as the body of the speaker gives a look of it.",positive

"Best smartphone within this price range. Just go for it. Like: - Processor - too good , no hanging and all, and quick power on and off . Screen - amoled display and of Samsung it's just amazing with best light effects and clarity. Camera - there are all the options live , slow motion , food etc and zoom is excellent. Soecial Feature - Multi split and multi pop up I loved this. Battery- 6000mah with full use battery drains after two days with full charge. Just awesome . Dislikes: - Weight wise bit heavy , but it's due to battery its expected. Overall a very good smartphone this is what I really wanted to buy and now I have it and really enjoying it. If you want to experience the real clarity go for it.",positive

If you want to buy this product for basic users then it's custom android MIUI has poor application management. I don't want any advertising pop-ups so I disabled all data for such apps and still those apps are taking data in background and updating itself. we even can not uninstall such stupid apps. Even by default music app also have Ganna linked to it which gives unnecessary suggestions of music videos. other than MIUI this phone is average with good battery life in this segment,neutral

"I’ve been using iPhones since the 3GS times. By far this phone is an example to show that Apple is constantly working upwards the make its own league with technology that is proving to be a huge convenience to lot of its followers. I have noticed that with the launch of XR, lot of android users have also moved on to IOS platform. And now with the 11 it’s just even better. The battery life starting from the XR model is the best Apple has ever come up with. Lasts an easy 24 hrs with little more than slightly below extensive usage. The iOS just gets better with every update. Shows that Apple employees work really hard compared to Samsung or other manufactures.",positive

In Daylight camera takes really decent photos. screen resolution is too good. Love to watch youtube, movies and prime video in full HD. Even I am playing PUBG Mobile without legs( balance setting). If you have HD earphone or headphone than definatly you gonna love the sound quality of this phone. Network quality is good. Selfi quality is ok ok. 2 sim cards and memory card all together, good for heavy users. And the powerful 5000 man battery backup, damn good. Wish Samsung will give 5000 mah battery back up in S Series. Easily it can run for a day. In short worth to buy this mobile ( for this price segment).",positive

"Really disappointed with the phone after using it for last 3-4 days. Please find below issues in the phone. 1 - Vibration of Notifications ---- I use apps like Twitter, FB as any general user... - and to be updated- I receive notifications --- The Most disgusting thing in the phone is - It keeps vibrating for each notification for each Tweet (by twitter), any kind of notification, the phone vibrates. It is so much disturbing that there is no option to disable it. I have talked to customer care, visited forums but this is Phone's default feature rather i will call it as - Defect feature.... It is so much distressing to keep phone on table or something... It continues vibration unless the only option is to switch off the phone or disable the mobile data, so that there is no notification. Haven't even expected from SAMSUNG that this basic feature Or I should say common sense to keep this option (to disable it) with user is missing in the phone. 2 - Mobile/wifi Internet access to specific app --- Now, I keep internet access off to specific apps like Netflix, youtube etc for kids Or personal use. But there is no option to disable internet access to specific app. I have tried using this feature by opting - Disable Background Access - But this does not serve the purpose, app still gets data and gets updated and it can be used. Please provide option to the user to restrict data for specific app. As a new Samsung user, please consider and implement this as feedback in your marketing and product development team ---- Better to focus more on simplicity of using the phone rather than spending on lot of advertisement. Phone lacks very basic features of disabling vibrations and restricting data. These features are most common and available in every phone.",negative
It's a real monster I am experiencing from last two days. Got delivery from Amazon as promised. As always Samsung done a very good job but at this price I was not expecting. Thank you Amzon for providing additional cashback. One thing I noticed missing that none of accessories provided in box except charger. Samsung could add a simple TPU case in box. I will appreciate Samsung for not using plastic bag for wrapping the box. We can say it's a ecofriendly box. Thank you Samsung and Amazon for this wonderful phone.,positive

"The last prime festival and the reviews coaxed us into buying the 49 inch model. Delivered after 5 days and installation appointment fixed after 10 days from purchase.

And now comes the hard part. Amazon defers the complaint to Kevin, who defers it back to Amazon in what seems to be a ball game. In fact, we could reach Kevin only once! Now, we stand as foolish customers as bait to the low prices, with no support from Amazon or Kevin. May be, we are the unlucky lot, which fall into the far end of the guassian curve.

"Was shopping for a good entry level big size tv for a while, was going for Samsung as a safer choice..But suddenly came across TecheeBiz review of 49' model of this brand. Went ahead to give it a try & got 55' model. Since then the brand kept me surprising in every aspect from packaging to installation. Things were smooth and as expected as of a standard company. For the tv itself, is very very good for what it does and at what price level it is definitely worrisome for elrctronic giants. Picture quality is definitely benchmark in the category and 4k upscale is pretty good. Audio quality output wise great but may feel little boomy at times. But it is actually a bonus as no one else provided sound bar as a built in in this category. Software wise also layout and usability of them feels okay. Hardware wise deficit of 1gb ram is not felt during routine functioning. I/O Ports are sufficient. Was a little disappointed to see that HDMI out didn't support Dts..Nor multichannel output. May have to confirm it again. Overall, it looks to be great choice and money well spent for a casual but keen user like me.",positive

Killer camera.Purchased at 15K red colour and thin design looks stunning.Some heating issues while charging and medium to high intense gaming. Surely, not for gamers.But, it flies in day to day usage.If you can live without headphone jack and 4-5 hrs. of screen on time,this is the phone for you.Software because of Android One is near stock and flawless.Recently got Android Pie update,very happy with my phone❤️",positive

Samsung galaxy has never been pocket friendly for me until I went through this M series mobiles. It's really an under budget phone for students like me plus this amazing diwali offer of Amazon. Fingerprint sensor works really well and it just unlocks my phone in no time but all the reviews said something different that I watched before buying this product. Anyway the camera quality is superb as we already know this is one of all Samsung phones' plus points. But this camera is much better than the other Samsung phones. The battery is the super long lasting one. It's been almost two days I have used this phone without giving it a little rest except my sleeping time and still I have 24% charge. I'm not a gamer so I think my charge will remain for a long time. I'm happy with my phone. One thing which I don't like that is there are almost no free stylised fonts. The two I have I do not like them at all. But the favourite ones are not free of cost. Anyway I'll get used to it I hope. Thanks Amazon and thanks Samsung for launching this m30s. I love it.,positive

"The phone performance is great but the reason i gave it 1 star is because the phone has a heating problem. My phone would work perfectly when im in a cold place but when ever im out in the sun or even in the car the phone heats up badly. Hen i figured out this problem, i contacted the customer care and went to the nearest samsung repair centre, at the centre they asked me to change the battery and i was asked to pay for that when my phone was in perfect condition less than 1 months old. It didnt seem ethical to me so i thought of not using the device. Samsung please solve my problem.",negative

I purchased it in 5 September. Now it's been more than a month and it's performance has never seen a downhill. You will love it's super fast bootup(SSD version). Battery life is good. I haven't tested it for gaming yet but surely it isn't a gaming pc. Although PUBG runs smoothly. MS Office has trial version so you will have to download it. Fingerprint sensor is also very fast. Bottom line is it is a good laptop. Purchase it and believe me you won't regret it.,positive

"I am using a Redmi 5 ( 32 GB ROM/ 3 GB RAM) for the past year and bought this for my dad. I will be comparing Mi A2 ( 128 GB ROM/ 6 GB RAM) with my Redmi 5 in this review. You will not get MIUI. Instead you will get stock/vanilla/pure android which DOES NOT HAVE THE FEATURES WHICH ARE THERE IN MY REDMI 5 1) Full Screen Gestures (Swiping from edge to go back, etc) 2) Second Space ( Something like Dual Booting but in Android) 3) Multiple WhatsApp Accounts on same phone 4) Split/Dual Screen 5) Many More MIUI Features I will talk about the BAD THINGS first. These include 1) Bad battery life because of less battery (3000 mAh) and high resolution (1080p) display. 4-5 Hrs of Screen On Time on Average. A battery bank is a must buy with this phone. 2) 2.4Ghz Wifi Range is really bad when compared to Redmi 5. (Although Mi A2 has 5 GHz, it needs Line Of Sight with the router to connect) 3) Display is really bright but minimum brightness allowed is too bright for a dark room. (When compared to Redmi 5) 4) Ambient Light Sensor is BAD. I prefer changing the brightness manually. 5) No headphone jack. Now for the GOOD THINGS 1) Really Fast And Smooth. Multitasking is a Breeze (No Split Screen Support). Switching between three games (Asphalt 9, PUBG-M and Shadow Fight 3) with no hiccups. 2) Pretty Good Camera. I have not tested in low light though. 3) Bright display visible under sunlight. 4) USB Type-C. Full charge from 20% in about an hour using the charger provided. 5) No pre-installed bloatware (Some MI apps are there but you can uninstall them) 6) Bluetooth 5.0 (Multiple bluetooth headphones can be paired simultaneously) 7) Good Loudspeakers 8) No Notch. 9) IR Blaster. (Can control any TV/AC with phone) When I bought it 2 months back, it was ₹19,000 whereas my Mi 5 was ₹9,000. Other than Mi A2 being smoother than Mi 5 (due to more RAM), the disadvantages far outweigh the advantages for me. According to me, if they provided a 6GB RAM version under ₹14,000, it would be a good deal. ₹19,000 was a bit much.",positive

"Just finished setting it up and initial impressions have been very good. Although I have to say I was expecting a big box which had some extra goodies, like the many youtubers (including Indian ) had been showing. I would suggest OnePlus to at least include them as a part of a deal. Any way once I started using the phone, all my complaints started fading away. That 90 Hz display gives a butter smooth touch experience. 2 days usage Update: *About the big box goodies mentioned in previous review above, they are available on OnePlus portal. So be ready to shell out money for the same. *camera is not in the league of iphone 11 or Galaxy Note 10 or even Pixel 3 but it ain't that bad either. But Macro mode is a big saviour. *Display is definitely the best part of the phone, along with the processor SD 855+ *Stereo Speakers can be pretty loud and clear *Battery is again not as good as iPhone 11 or Galaxy S10+ but it would be enough for a day's usage. And why worry much when we have warp 30T charger *I wish they could have included at least USB Type C Bullet earphones. *Overall quite content with the phone.",positive

"Reviewing the device after a months of usage. I have always been keen on using a new os and getting an experience. Have used the windows phone, the blackberry, and from last three years was with android and then during the big billion sale got an amazing offer on this iphone xr. Speaking of the device everything is good right from the display to the battery. People tend to compare devices with specs alone which is wrong. iOS offers different experience in terms of response, feedback, security, UI , etc. Camera is fabulous like no body ever complained on the photo or video clicked. The only downside as its kinda heavy ~200 grams. Battery life is good for me as it goes more than a day with full charge. Ram management is excellent, not a single lag in the course of one month usage. The display is colour accurate and is very bright. Yes its an LCD but no complaints out there. Network reception is strong and the speakers are true stereo. Would just say if you are the one who is bored with the chinese android and wants to use the apple flavour , this will be a good purchase.",positive

You'll become used to in 2-3 days of usage it's comfortable (it's light as ) Connectivity and usability is also very easy. Mic will work well most of the time, just ensure it's at the right place.

Pros - 1. long battery life. 2. Good camera. 3. Nice screen display with vibrant colors. 4. Doesn't hang while multi-tasking (as of 2 weeks old phone). 5. Value for money. Cons - 1. Takes more than 2 hours to charge full with in box charger. 2. UI is not the smoothest among other competitors (Redmi note 8 pro is better) 3. Face detection takes some time to unlock.,neutral
"I purchased this product after watching many online review videos and trusting brand Samsung that they must have improved their game in the last 5 years since I abandoned them. My overall experience is horrible! 1. The phone is terribly, terribly slow. It takes two seconds to unlock using the fingerprint scanner. Takes 1 second to launch simple apps like Messaging or Whatsapp. 2. The rear camera blows everything out of proportion. The colors, lighting etc. everything is blown out. Even an older device like iPhone 6 clicks much better and natural photographs. 3. The front camera is a farce. It tries to hide it's incompetence using artificial processing which means as soon as you zoom-in the image gets distorted. 4. The display is awesome. However, the auto-brightness doesn't works because there is no sensor at all. It relies on front camera and by the time it sense the lighting conditions they have most likely changed. 5. Notification options are too many and confusing. Could have been much simpler, I mean WHY??? and the lock screen does not lights up whenever there are any notifications, sometimes it will if it feels like. 6. Even the battery is not awesome. My POCO F1 delivered much better battery performance in a 4000 mAH battery. And it takes FOREVER, to charge this battery using the supplied charger. Like FOREVER!",negative

"Well I moved from an Android to a iPhone 7 and it has been the most disappointing purchase! Allow me to list down why an iPhone 7 is not worth its price or function. It lacks the basic of functionalities. 1. Unproductive Call Manager The default call manager doesn't store history of more than a week or so at the most. You won't find an app to cover this as Apple doesn't allow third party apps to import call history. In comparison to an android phone you would always find an alternative to anything that you find lacking on your phone. Organised call history with exact time stamp and duration of the call is the most important of phone functions and even worse you can't have it for more than a week - Ridiculous! 2. File Manager There is no concept of a file manager on an iPhone! One cannot view or sort files based on type, size or anything! The convenience of opening a file manager, sorting through relevant files you need is not available! No you cannot have a simple folder where can find your PDFs or zips or anything like that! 3. Photos Management I moved a thousand plus photos (3 to 5 albums) to my new phone and then thought it best to sort it into separate albums like personal or trek or college and others. The photos cannot be ""moved"" from any album to another, they can only be copied into other albums causing duplication and a disorganised library! 4. Custom Ringtone and Wallpaper My friend, using a ringtone of your choice is an uphill task. You'll have to connect your phone to your laptop, cut the file to 30 seconds update it into a particular format and push it back to your phone before you can use it as a ringtone, so much just to set up a ringtone? The same on Android would just be a one step process! Your wallpaper cannot be customised to add text onto the lock screen, you just cannot do it unless you take time off use photoshop or something similar and embed text save it as a jpeg and then use it as your wallpaper! 5. Basic Customisation There is no option to customise your home screen with just particular information or whatever you like. What if you want your first screen to be just a wallpaper without anything else like network, time, battery, app icons, but have everything once you swipe just right? Apple is sorry, you can't have any such customisation! On the android swipe down menu, you can add, rearrange, move, toggle do whatever you like, well the equivalent control panel on the iPhone is totally limited and non editable. Functions which you feel are more relevant cannot be added to the control panel and the irrelevant ones cannot be knocked off! 6. Music Getting the music you love onto your phone is no straightforward task, connect to iTunes, click on a thousand different buttons and push back before you can have it on your phone! 7. There is no radio compatibility! 8. iPhone does not sport a Corning Gorilla Glass This leaves the iPhone heavily lacking with basics and ease of customisations. Ps: 1. Solutions via the use of a laptop to overcome the shortcomings listed is a waste of time! 2. The excuse of improved security (via not giving access to third party app developers) limiting the functionalities of the phone is hopeless! Not everybody is a White House resident. 3. If I told you how often the phone hangs, and just goes bonkers statue, an iPhone will be last thing you buy! 4. All of the above is just a take on what it is, you are free to have yours as well!",negative

Mi is no doubt way better. - Battery is 5000mah as they say but does not work like that. Even in week 1, it died very easily. Another reason to give 1 is because Frapp, which asked us to buy this product didn’t pay my stipend earlier. They acted as Fraud company.",negative

"It seems rating here in Amazon is less. I purchased this model from Reliance Digital and also my laptop has cd drive. Model ideapad 330 151kb 81DC... It costed me 30,400. Also I got free bag which you won't get from Amazon, free quick heal pro, free additional 1yr warranty with insurance. So I'll suggest you to buy from 'em. Now coming to the laptop, don't see ratings here. The store advisor also said that this is a good laptop. I listed two- Asus x507 or this one. They said Asus has service issues and so I bought this. This laptop has all a 30k laptop can provide. Fhd anti-glare screen. And believe me the display isn't bad either it's good infact. Some people are telling bad 'cause they are comparing it with their fhd mobile. Obviously it won't be good as a mobile 'cause mobile has smaller screen and hence advantage. Yes, colors are a bit washed out but not much. Next is sound- it's good too though it could be louder. No heating issues The build quality is awesome though there's a bit flex but since it's plastic it will have some flex. So conclusion is the best in 30k if you purchase from retail shop",positive

"After using almost 2 years, now I can give a review, I think so, For a beginner sometimes it will be a little troublesome since it doesn't have touch screen, but if you totally ignore live view screen, then it is okay, though picture quality is crispy I also wanna say that while recording a video in a crowd it won't be hastle free experience because it lacks focus very trivially since people will come around infront of your subject but touch sceen focus could have solved this matter, else it is a very decent model to go for it. And coming to the low light condition, there is focus problem often, I mean extreme low light, with a sufficient light to foucs, it haven't caused a headache using this model.

At this price point the phone is just average. Definitely not bang for your buck. Phone does have a lot of bugs and the touch is not that responsive. Adding a 1000 ₹ to your budget will get you a better smartphone. And camera is definitely a let down. Photos taken are definitely bad as ever. Redmi 4 had a 2.0 aperture which took better photos than note 4 and redmi 7. This one has a f/2.2 aperture which at this price point just aint worth. Buy only as a spare phone.,neutral

Samsung M20 has a Infinity-V display . Nice mobile. Battery was holding up to 1.5 day with a high usage . (For myself) playing games , communication , face talks etc etc . Features are also nice . Update is possible when the phone is used for first time . Well done samsung . And great work by amazon . Storage 64 gb ( 14.1 fb for Internal os) it can be expandable up to 512 and 4 gb ram gives best performance . Hd display 16 cm screen .Was nice touch is good .

1) The battery charged 100% at night drains out 50% in the morning WITHOUT USE 2) The idea of speaker at the back is hopeless. 3) The 10 day return policy is insufficient and not justified. 4) will not order anything from amazon if product is not replaced with a perfect one.,negative

"If you're going to buy a new iPhone, this is the one to get – there's a slightly longer battery life, a better camera, fast innards and protection against water. However, many of the changes are slight, and the iPhone 6S, for the lower price, suddenly becomes a very attractive option. FOR: Good low light camera Water resistant Double the internal capacity AGAINST: Lacks clear upgrades Same design used for last three phones Battery life unimpressive",positive

"Phone is excellent in the market as with technology moving fast forwards it is good to change with the time. Hence in a low price of 6000, all features are good and we also have the option to change the phone as new technology arrives because it is not too costly also. Camera works fine with flash. Sound quality is good. UI is also good and the speed and processor will work fine for day to day use.",positive

Great phone at a competitive price... graabed this on amazon sale . 128 gb rom with 6 gig ram. Type c fast charger and our beloved headphone jack.. this phone has it all.. Pros... . Clean ui. Loads of software features like always on display. Swipe for ss .. ai emoji etc.. . Great cameras with super slowmo and pro mode. With 48mp camera.. . Huge battery 6000mah. All day long battery... . Screen is great . Vivid. And show true colours . Dual sim plus memory card slot. . Gaming mode. Power mode. Night mode... Cons.. . Frankly i didnt find any cons in this . (Saying From a normal person perspective. ) Every thing is balanced in this phone. And i will say it is the best deal in this segment.. as it is only made for india. So its budget heavy ... And worth the money,positive

There is a certain level of expectation for a product from SONY and that is why we are willing to pay more when compared to other brands. i am a bit disappointed with the quality of sound. The bass effect is good but you cannot raise the volume as the quality of sound is lost. I expected better from SONY for this price range!!,neutral
it is so difficult to organise it i have tried many times bt in no vain i had so many expectations from the product bt the product is disappointing,negative

"Don't rush and buy this phone , there are many defects , giving the review after 15 days of use...when you get a call , the flash light turns on automatically...and once u disconnect the call the mobile goes into vibration mode and you will realize only when u see missed calls..Camera clarity is also not that great..I feel most of the reviews are paid reviews for this phone...it's not a great phone..Don't buy!!",negative
